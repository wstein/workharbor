# Installable pilot execution record

Owner request: 2026-10-14, continue on `feat/installable-pilot` in the same worktree,
include Python-to-Go migration, independently review/fix each WI, PR after all WIs.
Latest owner instruction: while the owner is out of office, Sol subagents perform
intermediate planning/WI reviews and fixes; the owner reviews the final combined PR.
This supersedes the earlier intermediate human spec/plan-review workflow for this
authorized pilot execution. No historical human artifact approval is asserted, and
no pending intermediate human approval is treated as an execution blocker.
Status: proposed intermediate planning baseline; the prior Sol planning review
identified a terminal-safety ordering finding. Its correction awaits separate
independent Sol re-review before successor work. No product WI is accepted.
Baseline: `f02250fc75b1e72a1d949edaee128e31fffbaa53` (current design baseline).
The migration oracle remains `fd0019b7711438a2dbf7255ce3a43572d5a3a6fd`;
changing the design baseline does not change frozen Python behavior.
Authority: [Feature 001](../../../specs/001-workspace-lifecycle/spec.md),
[Feature 006 plan](../../../specs/006-whr-cli/plan.md),
[tasks](../../../specs/006-whr-cli/tasks.md),
[migration](../../../specs/006-whr-cli/migration.md).

## Progress

- Created and retained the pilot worktree; native permission approved branch switch.
- Read-only exact-baseline spec review identified a lifecycle/session retry ambiguity.
  Draft correction scopes durable retries to workspace lifecycle; uncertain agent
  input delivery is not automatically resent. Re-review pending.
- Official dependency research completed; proposal records concrete version/layout
  choices and identifies runtime-dependent transport/SSH decisions before those WIs.
- Pilot plan, migration inventory, data model, owner API design, tasks and validation
  guide drafted. No product code, task completion or live result claimed.
- Documentation checker and whitespace check passed before task-file generation;
  those historical checks do not establish acceptance of later revisions.
- Corrected the planning review finding: T011 requires baseline FR-022 human-text
  escaping, T014 requires the full baseline FR-022a stream filter and targeted
  hostile/split/unterminated tests, and T018 retains exhaustive corpus/fuzz and
  integration acceptance. `python3.14 scripts/check_repo.py` and
  `git diff --check` pass for this documentation correction; product runtime is
  not evaluated. Independent Sol re-review remains pending; final human review
  is reserved for the combined PR.

## Execution limitations

Native write approval was initially denied because the chat was scoped to SheetMill;
after explicit return/authorization, WorkHarbor writes were approved. No indirect
workaround was used. The configured Docker read-only probe did not complete and
was interrupted; this establishes no available host. No runtime was activated.
Signed release and live test/installation inputs are separate owner-controlled gates.
