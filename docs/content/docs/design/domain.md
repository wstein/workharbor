## 4. Domain model

| Object | Responsibility | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task | Issue, instructions, decisions, progress, results, PR link | Until completed, cancelled or failed |
| Workspace | A folder on the host or an external SSD: its agent clone, the agents' worktrees, the integration branch, tool config and caches (D42) | Created and removed by the human; outlives tasks, runs and environments |
| Agent | A named role in a workspace (for example `docs`, `runtime`): its worktree and branch `agent/<role>`, instructions, permission profile and session (D42) | Until the human removes it; works on many tasks in turn |
| Run | One execution of an agent in an environment | Start, pause, resume, terminate |
| Environment (`env`) | Container or VM backing a workspace; it runs the runs of the workspace's agents at once (D42). A console is an environment without an agent (D43) | Stopped or recreated independently of workspace data |
| **Decision** | A question, approval or review request raised to the human | Until answered |
| **ReviewCandidate** | Task → branch → commit SHA → PR → CI results, keyed by SHA | One per prepared revision: created when cleanup pins the SHA, before the push (§4.5) |
| Event | Append-only record of instructions, observations, decisions, actions | Permanent (audit trail and UI feed) |

### 4.1 State machines

Task, run and environment each get their own small FSM with explicit legal transitions; these are specified before coding.

- **Task** (D13):

    | From | To |
    | --- | --- |
    | `queued` | `running`, `cancelled` |
    | `running` | `awaiting_guidance`, `ready_for_review`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
    | `awaiting_guidance` | `running`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
    | `ready_for_review` | `running` (rework), `completed`, `cancelled` |
    | `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` | none (terminal) |

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> queued
        queued --> running
        queued --> cancelled
        running --> awaiting_guidance
        running --> ready_for_review
        running --> failed
        running --> cancelled
        awaiting_guidance --> running
        awaiting_guidance --> failed
        awaiting_guidance --> cancelled
        ready_for_review --> running: rework
        ready_for_review --> completed
        ready_for_review --> cancelled
        completed --> [*]
        cancelled --> [*]
        failed --> [*]
    ```

    - `awaiting_guidance` is for blocking Decisions raised by a run: a question or a tool approval from a live run, or `auth_expired` or `quota_exhausted` for a paused one (D23). The review Decisions of `ready_for_review` ("Ready to push?", §4.5) leave the task in `ready_for_review`.
    - **Rework** (`ready_for_review → running`) happens when the push is declined or the PR needs changes. It starts a new run on the same workspace and topic.
    - **`completed`** is set when the pushed PR is merged on the forge.
    - **`failed`** is terminal and maps to exit code 10 (§9.2). A failed run does not fail its task: it opens a blocking Decision (retry or cancel). A task fails only when a hard limit ends it (time or cost budget, a lost workspace) or the human answers that Decision with "give up". Both happen while the task is `running` or `awaiting_guidance`. In `ready_for_review` a lost workspace opens a review Decision instead (rework or cancel), so no other state needs a way into `failed` (D21).
    - A run paused by the human leaves its task `running`: pause is a run state. A run paused by `auth_expired` or `quota_exhausted` opens a blocking Decision, which moves the task to `awaiting_guidance` like any blocking Decision raised by the run (D21).
- **Run** (issue #15):

    | From | To |
    | --- | --- |
    | `starting` | `running`, `stopped`, `failed`, `interrupted` |
    | `running` | `paused`, `stopped`, `failed`, `interrupted` |
    | `paused` | `starting` (relaunch), `running` (cooperative pause), `stopped`, `interrupted` |
    | `interrupted` | `starting` (resume), `stopped`, `failed` |
    | `stopped`, `failed` | none (terminal) |

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> starting
        starting --> running
        starting --> stopped
        starting --> failed
        starting --> interrupted
        running --> paused
        running --> stopped
        running --> failed
        running --> interrupted
        paused --> starting: relaunch
        paused --> running: cooperative pause
        paused --> stopped
        paused --> interrupted
        interrupted --> starting: resume
        interrupted --> stopped
        interrupted --> failed
        stopped --> [*]
        failed --> [*]
    ```

    - **Pause is a run state.** Pausing never changes the environment (§4.3).
    - **Resuming a paused run.** None of the measured agents has a cooperative pause (D11), so pause is a hard interrupt: the agent process is gone while the run is paused, and resume relaunches it from the session. That is `paused → starting`, like a resume from `interrupted`, so a failed relaunch can end in `failed`. `paused → running` is for an agent that reports cooperative pause, whose process stays alive. If the process of a paused run is lost anyway, the run goes to `interrupted`. Every resume after a pause, a cancel or an interruption starts with a briefing from the supervisor (D27).
    - **`stopped`** is a normal end: the agent finished, or the run was cancelled. **`failed`** is an agent crash, a failed start or a failed resume.
    - **Into `interrupted`:** the reconciler (§5.3) marks a `starting`, `running` or `paused` run `interrupted` when its process or environment is gone: a supervisor or host restart, or a lost environment. Nothing else sets it, and a pending approval is raised again on resume (§4.2).
    - **Out of `interrupted`:** `starting` when the reconciler resumes the agent from its session in a running environment (§4.3); `stopped` when the task is cancelled; `failed` when resuming is impossible or its attempts are used up.
    - **One active run per environment counts `interrupted`** (issues #201, #216). Until several agents at once are built (#94), an environment holds at most one run that is `starting`, `running`, `paused` or `interrupted` (§4.3): an interrupted run still owns its environment, because it is resumed there. A new run's start and every path that moves a run to `starting` check it, the run itself excepted.
    - **One live agent per run** (issues #201, #202). Every path that moves a run to `starting`, the human's resume and the reconciler's recovery alike, holds that run's lock, reads the run again after taking it, and refuses when an agent session is already attached to it; it never replaces a session that is attached. A path that loses this race leaves the live session as it is and changes nothing else. So, within one supervisor process, cancel and pause always reach the agent that runs, and the reconciler never takes a live agent for a lost one.
    - **No surviving agent before a relaunch** (issues #201, #216). A supervisor that ends without stopping its agent (a crash, a kill, or a crash between saving a pause and stopping the agent) can leave the agent process running in the guest: ending the runtime's exec client does not end it (spike #7, Case 4, {{< status verified >}} on Apple Container 1.5.0), and a restarted supervisor cannot find it. So no agent is launched, a new run's included, in an environment the current supervisor process did not start without stopping and starting that environment first. Stopping an environment is how an agent left over from an earlier process is ended; that a stop ends every process in the environment is {{< status unverified >}} (seen in passing in the Apple Container spike, not measured; #216's live test measures it). Four paths apply it, each only to an environment the current supervisor process did not start, so each environment is stopped at most once per process lifetime and, because every launch goes through one of them, never under an agent this process launched:
        - **The reconciler** interrupts a `starting` or `running` run that has no attached session and then stops that run's environment. The stop interrupts every live run in that environment, attached or not, as any observed stop does (**Into `interrupted`**, above); each resumes with the briefing (D27). Recovery then starts the environment as for any stopped one.
        - **Every path that moves a run to `starting`, from `paused` or `interrupted`** (the reconciler's recovery, a quota resume that is due, the human's resume, and an answer that resumes) first stops and starts again such an environment; when that stop fails, the run keeps its state, nothing is launched, and for an `interrupted` run the failure counts an attempt.
        - **A new run's start** in such an environment (a task started on an agent, a retry, a rework) first stops and starts it; when that stop fails, nothing is launched and the start fails like an agent that cannot be started (§4.3: the run fails into a retry-or-cancel Decision and the environment is free again).
        - **Cancelling** a `paused` or `interrupted` run in such an environment also stops it, so a cancel reaches a leftover agent.
      A pidfile in the guest is not proof, because the agent can change it.
    - **Terminal runs are never reused.** A retry or rework starts a new run on the same workspace and topic (§4.1 task rules).
- **Environment** (issue #15):

    | From | To |
    | --- | --- |
    | `provisioning` | `stopped` (created), `deleted` (provisioning failed or abandoned) |
    | `stopped` | `running`, `deleted` |
    | `running` | `stopped` |
    | `deleted` | none (terminal) |

    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
        [*] --> provisioning
        provisioning --> stopped: created
        provisioning --> deleted: failed or abandoned
        stopped --> running
        stopped --> deleted
        running --> stopped
        deleted --> [*]
    ```

    - **Start and stop** move between `stopped` and `running`. After a service or host restart every environment is `stopped` (spike #2, §5.3), so the reconciler observes `running → stopped` and starts the ones that should run.
    - **Delete only from `stopped`.** A running environment is stopped first.
    - **Recycling** (§4.3) deletes an environment and provisions a new one, so it is a new Environment with a new ID. An environment is never reprovisioned.
- **Coupling rules** (issue #16). The three machines are not independent; a task aggregate (the task with its runs, their environments and its ReviewCandidates) checks these guards before a change is made:
  - **One live run.** A task has at most one run that is not `stopped` or `failed`, and a run is only created or started (from `paused` or `interrupted`) in an environment that is `running`.
  - **A new run is new.** `StartRun` takes a run that has not started (no state) and a non-empty ID that no run of the task has; a stopped or failed run is never passed back in. It is refused unless the task is `queued`, `running` or `ready_for_review` (rework, §4.1); a `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` or `awaiting_guidance` task starts no run. Once every guard has passed, `StartRun` moves a `queued` or `ready_for_review` task to `running` in the same change, so a rework run never stops under a `ready_for_review` task; a refused start moves nothing.
  - **Pause never stops the environment.** Pausing a run changes the run only. An environment is not stopped while a run in it is `starting` or `running`; a run is stopped or interrupted first.
  - **`ready_for_review` needs a stopped run and a pinned SHA.** The task's latest run is `stopped` (a `failed` run does not qualify), and a ReviewCandidate exists whose SHA is pinned (§4.5). The current revision is the most recent ReviewCandidate, and it records the run that produced it: it must be the latest run. Only the latest run may pin a revision, so a late pin from an older run cannot become the current one. After rework, a new run that stops without pinning a new commit leaves the task not ready, so the old SHA and its old CI result never carry over.
  - **CI belongs to a SHA.** A pipeline result is recorded on the ReviewCandidate of its own commit. A pass on an earlier SHA never counts for the current revision: where CI is required, `ready_for_review` is refused until the current SHA has passed.
  - **Violations are conflicts.** A broken coupling rule and an illegal transition are reported as a conflict, exit code 5 (§9.2). An unknown run, environment or SHA is "not found", exit code 3.

### 4.2 Decision object

Fields: ID, task, run (empty for a review Decision, which no live run raised), kind (`question | approval | review`), blocking flag, subject, input (untrusted, capped), commit SHA, options, status, created and answered timestamps, deadline, answer, reason and answering actor (issue #17). The inbox, `whr inbox`, notifications and the audit trail hang off it. "Awaiting guidance" is the state a task enters while a blocking Decision raised by a live run is open; review Decisions belong to `ready_for_review` (§4.1).

**Approvals are live and blocking.** Spike #1 showed the pattern with Claude Code: the agent's permission prompt is routed to the supervisor, which opens an `approval` Decision carrying the tool name and a capped copy of its input. The agent stays blocked until a human answers allow or deny, with an optional reason that is passed back to the agent. Rules:

- **Fail closed.** Deny on timeout (the spike used 10 minutes) and when the supervisor is unreachable.
- **What is shown is what is allowed, or it says so.** The input is capped at 2000 characters, and an approval whose input was cut anywhere on the way (in the adapter or the Decision) is marked `input_truncated`: the inbox, `whr inbox` and the API say that the allow covers more than is shown, so a human can deny what they cannot read. The tool name is the subject: a prompt whose name is not a tool name (letters, digits, `_ . : -`, at most 128 characters) is denied without asking. At most 8 prompts of one session wait for the human at once; one more is denied without asking, so an agent cannot flood the inbox.
- **Plan approval.** In plan mode the agent's `ExitPlanMode` arrives as an approval whose subject is the plan.
- **Capped input.** Tool inputs in a Decision are capped (the spike used 2,000 characters); the full input stays with the agent. All of it is untrusted data.
- **Status.** `open` becomes `answered`, `expired` (the deadline passed) or `superseded` (the supervisor restarted or the run was paused); each is terminal. Only `answered` with `allow` ever permits anything: an open, expired or superseded approval is a denial.
- **Approval channel transport (D26).** Approvals travel over the agent's stdio control protocol (`--permission-prompt-tool stdio`, `stream-json` in and out) on the runtime's interactive exec channel (`container exec -i`): `control_request` (`can_use_tool`) on stdout, `control_response` (allow or deny) on stdin, matched by `request_id`. An answer for an unknown `request_id` is denied, and open requests are denied when they are superseded (D23). A closed stdin fails closed without running the tool, and a crashed supervisor end or an unanswered request leaves the guest agent waiting with the tool unrun ({{< status verified >}}, spike #7), so when the channel is lost the supervisor stops the agent with `whr-shim` (D25) and records the request as denied. No guest-to-host network path, no listener and no approval token in the guest.
- **Deadline.** An approval always has one (default 10 minutes). An answer that arrives after it is refused and the Decision expires, so a late "allow" does not count. An approval that has none (a lost value, a damaged row) counts as past it: an answer expires it, and `Allows` is false. The store refuses to write such an approval and refuses to load one. Only a question or a review Decision may have no deadline.
- **A refusal can still change the Decision.** A late answer expires the Decision, and an allow for another commit is recorded as a denial, while both return an error. The store's `RespondDecision` loads, answers and saves in one transaction and saves the change even when the answer is refused, so a refusal is never lost to a rollback. The caller still receives the error (exit code 5).
- **Bad input is a usage error.** A missing actor or time, an answer that is not offered and a malformed new Decision are not conflicts: they exit with code 2 (§9.2). A conflict (code 5) depends on the Decision's state; a usage error does not.
- **Commit SHA.** A review Decision such as "Ready to push?" carries the pinned SHA of its ReviewCandidate (§4.5, §6). An allow is tied to that SHA: an allow given for a different SHA is recorded as a denial, and the supervisor asks `Allows(sha)` against the commit it is about to push, so an approval for an earlier revision never covers a later one.
- **Pause and restart** (D23). A Decision raised by a live run (a question or an approval) is `superseded` when the supervisor restarts or the run is paused: pause is a hard interrupt (D11), so the agent process that asked is gone and could not receive the answer. The reconciler, or the resume, raises a new one when the agent asks again (§5.3). An answer sent to a superseded Decision is refused as a conflict (§9.2, exit code 5). A review Decision belongs to no run, so it survives both, and so do the login and quota questions below: they are raised for a run that is already paused, and nothing waits on them. This is the one restart rule; §4.1 and §5.3 refer to it.
- **Expired auth and quota** (D23). `auth_expired` and `quota_exhausted` are blocking `question` Decisions raised for the paused run, not approvals, because nothing is being permitted. Their options are fixed: for `auth_expired`, "Signed in again, resume" or "Cancel"; for `quota_exhausted`, "Resume now", "Resume at reset" (with the reset time when the agent reports it) or "Cancel". The run stays paused and the task moves to `awaiting_guidance` (§4.1, D21). They have no deadline: waiting is safe, because nothing runs until they are answered.
- **Rebase conflict** (D42). A conflict found when the supervisor rebases an agent's branch onto the integration branch, before the export (§4.5), is a blocking `question` Decision raised for the stopped run whose branch it is, because no live run can be asked and the run ended there. The rebase is aborted inside the environment first, so the branch is as the agent left it. The options are fixed: "Rework" (a new run on the same agent, whose briefing names the conflicting paths, D27), "Resolved in the console, retry" (the human fixed it in the console, D43, and the supervisor rebases again) and "Cancel". The input lists the conflicting paths as untrusted data. A rebase outside a task, such as one asked for by the human, returns the conflict to the caller and raises no Decision.
- **Egress requests (D38).** A host that a repository's `devcontainer.json` requests or a lockfile suggests is opened only by the human's allow, stored per repository on the supervisor's side; nothing in the repository grants it. The question is asked once, at the first start of a run that would use the environment: the run is created and stays `starting`, and one blocking `approval` Decision per unanswered host is raised for it, with cause `egress_request` and the host in its own field (a host name the reader validated, never parsed from the subject or input, which only describe it and its source). The task moves to `awaiting_guidance` as for any blocking approval. Allow adds the host to the repository's allowlist and deny records it as refused; either answer is kept, so later runs and other workspaces of the repository are not asked again. The deadline and the restart rule are an approval's: an expired or superseded request is a denial for this run only and is asked again at the next start. The environment exists already (it is made with the workspace, D42) and starts with the hosts already allowed. The agent process is started only once every request of the run is answered; if an answer allowed a new host, the supervisor first recreates the environment's proxy sidecar with the new allowlist, which is safe because no agent process runs yet. A denied host leaves the run to start without it. The allowlist never changes while an agent process runs. A host added to the repository later is asked at the next start. Changing an answer is a policy change (§6), outside the run.
- **Feature sources (D38, issue #127).** A devcontainer feature from a source outside `ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/` is asked like an egress host: one blocking approval per reference, cause `feature_source`, the reference in its own field, the answer kept per repository and answered only with a passkey step-up on the web (D45). An allow takes effect when the environment is next built: a new workspace, or `whr ws rebuild <workspace>`, which the human runs while no agent of that workspace runs and which keeps the home and build volumes (issue #128); nothing rebuilds by itself.
- **Card queue (D30, D40, issue #71).** A card the human moves to an agent queue on the board raises a blocking question, cause `board_queue`, "Accept this task?" with the options start and cancel; it never starts a run by itself, once per card state. The project board does not say who moved a card, so the mover is treated as untrusted and only the issue author's trust tier is applied; the human's answer is what starts the run.
- **Task state (D13, D23).** Only a blocking Decision raised by a run moves its task to `awaiting_guidance`: a question or approval from a live run, a login or quota question for a paused one, or a rebase conflict for the stopped run whose branch it is. A review Decision belongs to no run and leaves the task in `ready_for_review`.

### 4.3 Lifecycle rules

- IDE/SSH disconnect does not pause the agent or stop the environment.
- **Detached sessions.** The agent process runs inside the environment under the supervisor with no client attached. Chat is attach and detach over a persistent session, never the owner of the process. Session state (transcript and agent session ID) lives in the workspace, so it survives a supervisor restart and a reattach from another client. The reconciler (§5.3) resumes from that session after a restart.
- A long run can outlive its credentials. Expired auth or an exhausted usage window pauses the run and opens a blocking Decision (§5.2) instead of failing it.
- Pausing lets a human inspect or edit without concurrent agent changes. Human takeover holds an explicit, visible workspace lock (agent vs human); on resume the agent is re-synced with the human's changes.
- Stopping an environment preserves files, logs and agent session state.
- Agent-level checkpoint/resume is distinct from VM suspend and must work on backends without suspend.
- Environments awaiting review may be stopped.
- **Worker recycling** (recreate the environment, keep the workspace) is a first-class lifecycle action because freed guest memory is not returned to macOS.
- Only validated runner × backend pairs may claim resumability.
- **Workspaces and agents (D42, issue #90).** A `Workspace` has a unique name (lowercase letters, digits and `-`, 1 to 40 characters, starting with a letter), a host folder, the repository it was seeded from (`owner/name`), its integration branch (`main` or `develop`) and its environment. An `Agent` has a role (the same character rules, at most 30 characters), unique within its workspace, and gets the branch `agent/<role>` and the worktree `/ws/wt/<role>` inside the environment from it; neither is chosen freely, so a name from a repository's issue or an agent's own output never becomes a path or a ref by itself. A task is assigned to one agent (`Task.AgentID`) and its runs carry the same agent. The model allows several agents per environment, but **the service allows one active run (`starting`, `running`, `paused` or `interrupted`, §4.1) per environment** and refuses a second with the conflict `environment busy` until several agents at once are built (#94). Workspaces and agents are registry records the human creates and removes; they are not part of a task's aggregate and are not changed by task events, so each change is recorded as an audit event in the stream `workspace:<id>` (the event log is keyed by a task or by such a stream). **Creating a workspace** checks the folder (empty, below a workspace root, not inside a git repository; §5.6), seeds the agent clone with `hostgit` (the only time the host runs git there), records the workspace, provisions and starts its environment with the folder mounted read-write at `/ws`, and adds the first agent: `git worktree add` runs inside the environment, never on the host. A failed step takes back what the earlier ones made. **Starting a task on an agent** records the task and its run and checks the one-run rule in one transaction, so two starts cannot both pass; it then starts the agent in its worktree. If the agent cannot be started the run fails into a retry-or-cancel Decision and the environment is free again. One environment serves its workspace's tasks one after the other, so an environment ID can be in several tasks. **Rebasing** an agent's branch onto the integration branch runs `git rebase` in the agent's worktree inside the environment, and is refused while the agent has a starting or running run. A conflict aborts the rebase and is returned with git's report as the conflict `rebase-conflict`; the export (#91) turns it into a Decision on the task. The repository cache and per-task clones of `hostgit` stay until that export replaces the fetch from a stopped environment (§4.5).

### 4.4 Persistence semantics

Decided from spike #2 (Apple Container, issue #2; confirm on other backends):

- **Workspaces live on the host or an external SSD** (D42), outside containers and volumes, and are mounted into their environment read-write. A workspace holds its own agent clone and the agents' worktrees; the human's own repositories are never mounted. Workspaces survive any environment, and one environment serves all agents of a workspace. This replaces per-task clones of a repository cache (D17); the agent clone stays in the workspace folder, and dependency directories follow D39 per worktree. Whether the agents' worktrees move onto a volume is open (D39, issue #119); if they do, it is one volume per workspace environment with a directory per agent, kept when the environment is recreated.
- **The agent home** (auth directory, session, caches) is one writable named volume per environment. A volume survives stop, start, delete and rebuild.
- **A writable volume is exclusive.** While one container has it read-write, no other container can attach it, not even read-only (the second start fails with "The storage device attachment is invalid"). A rebuild stops the old container before the new one starts. A volume can be shared read-only by several containers.
- **A bind-mounted checkout is slower but usable.** For 5000 files with 300 edits, the first `git status` took 0.3 to 1.1 s on a bind mount against 0.12 s in a volume, later runs about 100 to 130 ms against 75 to 118 ms, `git add` 363 ms against 120 ms, and `commit` 667 ms against 334 ms. Git tuning (untracked cache, `feature.manyFiles`, preloaded index) changed steady-state `status` by almost nothing, because the cost is the cold first stat of every file. Very large repositories were not measured; the cold pass grows with the file count.
- **Dependency directories stay off the bind mount (D39).** Spike #40 measured file-metadata work on a bind mount at 20 to 100 times the cost on a volume for large trees (153 000 files: warm `git status` 8 s against 0.1 s, copying the tree 128 s against 1.5 s; 40 000 small files of a `node_modules` shape: 1.8 s against 0.04 s), while a CPU-bound build took the same time on both. So the untracked trees that hold most of a repository's files are moved to a per-environment volume where the tool reads its location from the environment (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`), and covered by a volume mounted over the checkout only where it cannot be moved (`node_modules`). A mount point inside the bind mount cannot be removed or renamed in the guest (EBUSY), shows the volume's `lost+found` and hides host files at that path (spike `volume-over-bind`), which is why relocation comes first. The checkout itself stays on the host. Results: [spike #40](../spikes/bind-mount-perf.md).
- **Caches and build output stay on the volume, outside the checkout.** A real build (this repository's `make check`, including golangci-lint and editorconfig-checker compiled from source, 4 CPUs) took 45 s cold and 2.3 s warm with everything on a volume; with only the checkout on a bind mount it was 41 s and 2.7 s, no measurable cost; with the Go caches (about 25,700 module files and 7,800 build-cache files) on the bind mount as well it was 56 s and 4.7 s, about twice as slow warm. The adapter sets `GOMODCACHE`, `GOCACHE` and the package-manager and build-directory equivalents to paths on the environment's volume. A tree with many small files of its own, such as `node_modules`, will behave like the cache case and was not measured.
- **Bind mounts sync both ways at once**, and files the guest root writes appear owned by the host user.
- **The root filesystem is disposable.** It survives stop and start and is lost on delete, so nothing that matters lives there.
- **Mounts are rejected by the adapter, not the runtime.** The runtime accepts any host path. The adapter calls `runtime.CheckMount` before every mount: it resolves symlinks first, then rejects `$HOME` and its parents, `~/.ssh`, other secrets directories and runtime sockets (§7.4), and the conformance suite checks it.
- **Tools are not part of the workspace.** Agent CLIs come from a shared read-only store (§5.6).

Still open: retention and garbage collection of completed tasks, topics and workspaces on the host disk (§8), quotas (a named volume is a sparse image with a virtual size of 512 GiB), and repositories that track more than about 50 000 files, whose `git status` stays slow on a bind mount even with dependencies on a volume (D39, §12), and with them whether the agents' worktrees move onto a volume (issue #119, waiting on its measurement).

### 4.5 Topics, checkouts and cleanup before push

A **topic** is one line of work: one branch (`agent/<topic>`) with its own checkout on the host. Several topics are in flight at once, each with its own environment and agent, and the developer can open any checkout in their editor at the same time. That is the worktree idea: parallel topics that are merged and tidied locally before anything leaves the machine.

**Since D42** a topic is an agent's branch in a workspace: each named agent works in its own worktree of the workspace's agent clone, rebases onto the integration branch, and its commits leave as a `git bundle` exported from the running environment (issue #91), not through a fetch from a stopped environment. The import is a fetch of the bundle into a supervisor-owned repository that lacks its objects: `git bundle verify` alone passed a bundle truncated to half its size, while the fetch refused it and left no ref (spike #89). The per-task clone of D17 is gone (issue #95); its cleanup and push rules (prepare, per-SHA approval, push, no rewriting of pushed commits) carry over unchanged.

**The export as built (issue #91).** `Request.Agent` names the agent whose branch is exported. The supervisor's **forge mirror** (the repository cache of D17 without its per-task clones, D42) stays: a bare repository per forge repository, fetched only from the forge, never from a workspace and never mounted into an environment. `Prepare` first refreshes the target from it into the supervisor's repository, because the bundle's prerequisite is the branch's merge base with the integration branch. For a first round it then runs `git rebase` in the agent's worktree inside the environment; a conflict aborts the rebase and raises the blocking question of §4.2 for the stopped run, with the conflicting paths as untrusted input (a later round is a fast-forward and is not rebased: pushed commits are never rewritten). Then `git merge-base` and `git bundle create - <base>..<branch>` run in the guest, through the same exec path (and its launcher) as the agent, under a timeout (default 5 minutes). Their output is streamed into `Repo.ImportBundle`, which caps it (default 512 MiB), fetches it into a scratch repository that borrows only the supervisor's objects, checks that the branch arrived whole and only then fetches it into the supervisor's repository; the scratch is removed on every path. The environment keeps running, and no git runs in the workspace on the host. A rewrite of commits already pushed is refused as before, by `hostgit.Prepare` against the revision's recorded source. `OpenCopy` exports the same way, so the editor copy is fresh while the environment runs, and is cloned from the supervisor's repository, never from the workspace.

**Checkout layout** (spike #2, item 9):

- **Each workspace has its own full agent clone** (D42), made once by `SeedAgentClone` from the forge or from a repository path: an independent clone with no alternates, no hardlinks, no template and an origin that is a plain https URL, never a host path. The agent works in a worktree of it inside the environment. The supervisor keeps no per-task clones and mounts no object cache into an environment.
- **Clone depth is a per-repository setting, `clone_depth`, default 0 (full history), of the forge mirror.** A positive value fetches the mirror with `--depth` for very large repositories; refreshing it then needs a forced refspec and a target is taken with `fetch --update-shallow`; once the target moves further than the depth past a branch's fork point there is no merge base. The supervisor therefore checks for a merge base before a rebase and deepens the mirror and its own copy (`--deepen`) until it finds one. A partial clone (`--filter=blob:none`) keeps the full history and may be the better option; it was not tested.
- **Worktrees of one repository** (`git worktree`) are the developer's tool on the host for their own parallel topics. They are not handed to agents. A worktree's `.git` file points at the shared repository by host path: mounting only the worktree fails (`not a git repository`), and mounting the shared repository exposes every branch, the shared hooks and config, and the other worktrees' metadata. `git worktree add --relative-paths` makes the pointer work if the mounts keep the relative layout, but the exposure is the same.

**Cleanup before push:**

- **Agents do not push.** The agent commits in its topic's checkout. Nothing leaves the host until a cleanup step has run and been approved.
- **Prepare for push.** The supervisor, on its own copy of the topic (`hostgit`, below), rebases it onto its target, folds attempts into one commit per finished change (fixup and autosquash of unpushed commits only), checks the commit messages (conventional commits and the repository's commit linter), signs the commits with the bot key (§7.7) and runs the repository's checks. Several finished topics can be merged into one integration branch first.
- **Approval.** The result is a ReviewCandidate (a pinned commit SHA) and a Decision, "Ready to push?", that shows the commit list and the diff stat. Approval is per commit SHA, as for any review (§6).
- **Push and PR.** On approval the supervisor pushes the prepared `agent/*` branch with the run's scoped credentials and opens or updates the PR. Merging stays human, on the forge.
- **Pushed commits are never rewritten.** After a push a topic is only extended; rewriting pushed history needs an explicit request. Each revision records the agent's own tip it was prepared from; a follow-up round rebases only the agent's newer commits onto the pushed revision, so the next push is a fast-forward. An agent that rewrote commits it had already handed in is refused rather than guessed at. Publishing needs the task in `ready_for_review` and an approval of its current revision, so a cancelled task or an approval of an earlier revision publishes nothing, and the repository's checks are required.
- **Done or cancelled topics.** The checkout and its branch are removed by the retention rules (§4.4, issue #54) after the push is merged or the topic is cancelled. Unpushed work is kept until the owner discards it.

**Prepare and push in code** (issue #27). The steps above run in this order, on the supervisor's own copy: the target comes from the mirror, the agent's branch is imported from a bundle (above), `EnsureMergeBase` finds a base, and `Prepare` rebases the branch onto the target in a temporary worktree with `--autosquash` (hooks off, the bot as committer, commits signed with the bot key), then lints every commit message and returns the new tip. Running the repository's own checks is not done by `hostgit`: they are the repository's code, so a `Checker` runs them in an environment, never on the host. The tip is pinned (`PinRevision`) and a review Decision "Ready to push?" is raised for that SHA. `Push` sends one `agent/*` branch, fast-forward only, as the exact approved commit (`<sha>:refs/heads/<branch>`), never with force and never tags.

```

**The editor copy** (issue #59). The developer's editor is never pointed at an agent's checkout: opening it runs planted repository config on the host (VS Code and its git extension, direnv, `.vscode/tasks.json`; threat model T15). `EditorCopy` clones the supervisor's own bare copy of the topic (which the bundle import filled) into a directory outside the workspace root, with an empty template and none of the agent's config, hooks or alternates, and refreshes it later with a fast-forward only, so the developer's edits are never overwritten. It refuses a destination inside the workspace root, so the agent's checkout cannot be handed out by mistake. The commits themselves are the agent's work and may contain files an editor acts on (`.vscode/tasks.json`, `.envrc`, `.devcontainer`), so the copy lists them and the UI warns before the folder is trusted.

**The forge contract** (§10) separates Git transport from the forge API. The adapter is wrapped in a `Guard` that holds the autonomy table: `OpenPR` and `UpdatePR` take an `Approval` (the Decision and the commit SHA) and are refused unless the Decision allows that SHA and the branch at the forge points at it; `Push` needs the same proof; `Merge`, `Tag`, `Release` and `Deploy` are refused whatever the table says (the table's ceilings), and the inner adapter is never called for them. An `Issue` carries the author association for trust tiers (#53), and `VerifyWebhook` takes the request's `http.Header`.

**The host treats every agent-writable checkout as hostile** (§7.4), and since D42 runs no git in one at all: an agent's commits arrive as a bundle read as a stream, never as a fetch from its `.git`.

**`hostgit`** (issue #19) is the only way the host runs git on anything an agent can write:

- **No git in a workspace on the host.** The only time the host runs git in a workspace's clone is when it does not yet exist: `SeedAgentClone` makes it. After that the agent works inside the environment, and its commits leave as a bundle (`ImportBundle`): read as a stream with a size cap, fetched into a scratch repository that borrows only the supervisor's objects, checked as a whole (`git bundle verify` alone passed a bundle cut in half, spike #89) and only then fetched into the supervisor's repository, with object checks (`fsckObjects`) on. Cleanup (rebase, fold, sign) and push run only on that supervisor-owned repository. An earlier design let the host read an agent's checkout with an allowlist of read-only plumbing after a check of its `.git`; that code is removed.
- **The expanded tree is capped before any checkout.** Only a bundle's compressed size was capped, and a few kilobytes of tree objects can name billions of files, or billions of trees with no file at all (a tree that lists the same subtree twice, nested). `Repo.CheckTree` streams `git ls-tree -r -t -l -z` of a commit, counting trees as well as files, and stops git as soon as it passes `MaxTreeEntries` (200,000 entries) or `MaxTreeBytes` (2 GiB of blobs). `Prepare` replays every commit of the topic into a host worktree, so `CheckCommits` checks the tree of each commit after the target (or after the pushed source in a follow-up round), once per tree id, for at most `MaxTopicCommits` (2,000) commits: a bomb that a later commit deletes is refused too. `--autosquash` builds a tree no single commit has (the union of what a chain of fixups added), so `CheckCommits` also caps what the topic adds as a whole: the entries and blob bytes each commit introduces over its parent, summed, at `MaxTopicEntries` (400,000) and `MaxTopicBytes` (4 GiB). The branch is resolved to a commit ID once, and the check and the checkout use that ID, so a branch that moves in between cannot slip past. The check, `Prepare` and `EditorCopy` run under hard deadlines (`CheckTimeout`, `PrepareTimeout`, `EditorCopyTimeout`). A refusal is `ErrTreeTooLarge`. Tests build a 2^30-file bomb from 31 objects, a 2^40-tree bomb with no file from 41, and a bomb in one commit deleted by the next, and require a quick refusal.
- **A hardened floor on every host git command.** Git starts with an empty environment (no `GIT_*` from the host, a minimal `PATH`, an empty `HOME`, no system or global config, no terminal prompt, no optional locks, no replace objects) and `-c` overrides that disable hooks (`core.hooksPath`), the file-system monitor, the pager and editor, credential helpers, signing, submodule recursion, and every transport except `file` where a fetch from a local repository needs it.
- **The forge mirror** (issue #45, D42). `Cache` is the bare repository per forge repository, with the repository's `clone_depth` (default 0). `Refresh` fetches one branch from the forge with the forced refspec `+refs/heads/<b>:refs/heads/<b>`, no tags, objects checked, and `--depth` for a positive depth (an existing shallow mirror is made complete with `--unshallow` when the depth is 0). The source is an absolute path or an `https://` URL without credentials; every other scheme (`ssh`, `ext::`, `file://`) and anything that starts with a dash is refused, and an authenticated fetch comes with the forge adapter (issue #27). It is fed only from the forge, never from a workspace, and never mounted into an environment.
- **One writer per cache** (issue #67). Every operation on a cache (refresh, deepen, clone, merge-base search, maintenance) runs under a per-cache lock: a mutex shared by every handle of the same path and a file lock (`whr.lock`) for other processes, waited for with the caller's context. Git's own lock files (`shallow.lock`, `packed-refs.lock`, ref locks) are never left to block the next refresh: while the cache lock is held no other supervisor process runs git on it, so a lock file found then is stale and is removed first. Three parallel shallow refreshes had failed 40 times in 60 on `shallow.lock` without it.
- **Names map to directories by a strict rule.** `CachePath(repo)` accepts only `owner/name` made of ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-` (each part starting with a letter or digit, at most 100 characters), lowercases it, and appends a short hash, so `Foo/x` and `foo/x` are one cache on a case-insensitive disk and no name, path separator or Unicode form can leave the cache root. A cache path must be absolute and inside the cache root when one is set (`WithCacheRoot`), a relative path is refused instead of being created under `/`, and a local source inside a workspace root (agent-writable) is refused.
- **Merge base before a rebase.** `EnsureMergeBase` looks for a merge base between the target and the topic in the supervisor's copy. While there is none and either side is shallow it deepens the cache (`fetch --deepen`) and then the copy (`fetch --update-shallow --deepen`) by a step, up to a limit, and reports `ErrNoMergeBase` when the limit is reached or both sides are complete, so the caller opens a Decision instead of rebasing blindly.
- **Tested.** Tests plant a hook, `core.fsmonitor` and a clean filter in a workspace's `.git`; the bundle import never runs them, and a control run of host git in the clone shows each one fires (spike #89). Truncated, corrupted, oversize and garbage bundles are refused and leave no ref.
