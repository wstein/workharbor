title: Prepare the Mac mini
description: A minimal, hardened host for WorkHarbor on an Apple-silicon Mac mini.
weight: 1

A checklist for the host, in order. Each step says why. Steps marked {{< status unverified >}} have not been tried on a real setup yet. The design decisions behind this page are D28 (software) and D29 (reachability) in the [design](../design/_index.md).

## The quick way: `whr setup` (provisional)

Two commands do most of this page, and the steps below stay the reference for what they do. Both check a step first, show the exact commands of its fix, run them only after you answer `y`, and check again; a step whose check passes does nothing. They need a terminal, and `--dry-run` runs the read-only checks for real and prints every fix without running any. `--only <step>` and `--from <step>` pick steps (the shell completes their names), and the steps marked optional run only when named.

1. **As your administrator account, not `root`; and not `workharbor` unless it is an administrator itself (D49):** `whr setup host`. It first runs `config-first` (issue #394): the same base-configuration step as `config-base` of `whr setup` (repository, the numbered volume choice below, account, then a diff and your `y`), because `workspace-volume` and `spotlight` read the workspace roots from `config.json`. It writes `$HOME/.config/whr/config.json` of the account that runs setup (or the path of `--config` / `WHR_CONFIG`), and only when that account is the one WorkHarbor runs as (`--user`, for a shared account: `whr setup host --user "$USER"`). The administrator of a separate `workharbor` account never writes into that account's home: there, `config-first`, `workspace-volume` and `spotlight` are reported as not reachable (no `FAIL`, and no `sudo` password asked for them) with the action to run `whr setup --only config-base` as `workharbor`, in its desktop session; reading `workharbor`'s configuration from the administrator is an open question {{< status unverified >}}. A step whose precondition is missing is always reported this way, ordered before any password prompt. After `config-first`, it covers steps 2 to 5 and 8: the standard user `workharbor`, power settings, the firewall, SSH with keys only, FileVault (guided, because enabling it prints a recovery key whr must not see), no automatic log-out (guided: `autologout` reads `com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay`, an unset key, an empty answer or 0 is fine; any value or message the check does not know is `not_verified`), the workspace volumes (`workspace-volume`: a root under `/Volumes` must be encrypted, which is guided because it needs your passphrase, and must honour ownership, which whr turns on with `sudo diskutil enableOwnership`; both read `diskutil info` text, and the key and the output format are {{< status unverified >}} on macOS 26), Homebrew (downloaded, shown and run only after your confirmation, see step 5) and the Brewfile with `brew pin container`, and the `/opt/whr` prefix. Every privileged command runs as its own `sudo` command, shown first; it asks for your password once (`sudo -v`) and never keeps it alive. A file that must be root's is written to a private temporary file and installed with `sudo install`. Screen Sharing is guided and optional. Tailscale (issue #408, optional, named with `--only tailscale`) is installed when missing with `brew install --cask tailscale-app`, after the usual confirmation (`--yes` skips the prompt, a dry run only prints it); it never runs as root or with `sudo`. Signing in, and approving a system or network extension if macOS asks, stay yours ({{< status unverified >}}). The Brewfile names the cask `tailscale-app`. Measured read-only on one host on 2026-10-08: `brew info --cask tailscale-app` prints `tailscale-app (Tailscale): 1.102.4`, and `brew info --cask tailscale` resolves to the same cask (an alias or rename there); older brew versions and other machines are {{< status unverified >}}. `--only tailscale-serve` names the serve step, as `--only tailscale` names the install step. Which account runs the serve step, and whether the administrator's `tailscale` reaches the serve configuration of the app while `workharbor` is signed in, is not measured {{< status unverified >}}. The `tailscale-serve` step then reads `tailscale serve status` and offers `tailscale serve --bg <port>` with the port of `listen`.
2. **Install whr** from a draft release (step 13, `make install-release`): the wizard accepts a `whr` wherever it lies (alpha policy, issue #493): in a Git working tree, in `/usr/local/bin`, in a directory you can write, or owned by the account that runs it. It refuses `root`, and a file that is not an executable regular file after symbolic links. `whr doctor` reports where `whr` runs from, and who owns or can write the prefix, as one `warn`: it does not change the exit code, and a missing `/opt/whr` is part of that warn when `whr` runs from elsewhere. The guest helpers are looked for next to the running binary (`<dir>/../libexec/whr`), because `whr serve` looks there. The administrator-owned prefix stays the recommended install; the stricter rule is revisited at beta. Not run on a real host {{< status unverified >}}.
3. **As `workharbor`, in its desktop session (Terminal on the Mac, or over Screen Sharing), not over SSH:** `whr setup`. It covers steps 6, 12 and 13: the container kernel and system, the standard-user check, the private `~/.config/whr`, the API token (generated, never shown), an optional API key (typed without echo), the base configuration, `whr github app create`, the configuration's GitHub App keys (shown as a diff and written after a `y`, keeping every key it does not know), the tool store and `whr service install`.

**The volume choice** (issue #387). When `whr setup` creates `config.json` it lists the volumes `diskutil list -plist` mounts, each read with `diskutil info -plist`, and asks which one holds the workspaces. It only chooses a folder; it never erases, formats or adds a volume. Read on one Mac with macOS 26 {{< status verified >}}: the keys `VolumeName`, `MountPoint`, `FilesystemType`, `TotalSize`, `Internal`, `Writable`, `SystemImage` and `APFSContainerFree`; on APFS `FreeSpace` is 0, so the free space shown is the container's. Not read yet {{< status unverified >}}: an external disk (`Internal` false, `FreeSpace` of exFAT, FAT or HFS+ volumes), locked or unmounted volumes, and Macs with many disks.

**Which volumes can be chosen, and the workspace folders** (issue #395). Only APFS volumes can be chosen. exFAT, FAT, NTFS and HFS+ volumes are listed with `not usable` and the reason (no Unix owners or modes, and macOS ignores ownership on external volumes by default, so every account could write the workspaces); choosing one is refused, `--yes` included. Each volume shows `encryption: yes`, `no` or `unknown`, read from the `FileVault` key of `diskutil info -plist`; whr warns, and does not block, on an unencrypted external APFS volume (section 3 says how to encrypt it) and when ownership is ignored on the volume (`GlobalPermissionsEnabled` false). Keys read with `diskutil info -plist /` on the developer's Mac, macOS 26 {{< status verified >}}: `FileVault` (true), `GlobalPermissionsEnabled` (true), `FilesystemType` (`apfs`), `Internal`, `Locked`; `Encryption` (true) and `EncryptionThisVolumeProper` (false) also exist but are not used, because what they mean for an external volume is not known. No external disk was attached, so the keys' values on an external APFS volume (encrypted, unencrypted, locked, ownership off) are {{< status unverified >}}; a missing or non-boolean key shows `unknown` and warns about nothing. The host step `workspace-folders` then makes each workspace root: `sudo mkdir -p <root>`, `sudo chown -h workharbor <root>`, `sudo chmod -h 0700 <root>` (`-h` so a link in the last place is never followed; checked to be accepted on macOS), one argument vector each. `--dry-run` describes them, and `sudo -v` is asked once, only after the real commands are known, so not when everything is right or you decline. Mode `0700` is the mode whr gives its own folders; the design names no other for the workspaces. It refuses a root under a symbolic link, one on another volume than its path says, and a `/Volumes/<name>` path whose disk is not mounted (it would land on the boot disk), and runs the commands on the resolved path, checked again after your `y` and, for a changed owner, again after your answer to the owner question. `--yes` never answers that owner question, and `--unattended` stops at it. A folder that exists with the right owner and mode is left alone; a different owner is reported and `chown` is only offered, default no. The check is `ok`, `fail` or `not_verified` (no configuration yet, or `df`/`stat` did not answer). The `container-storage` folder the issue mentions has no configuration key in this version, so only `roots.workspaces` is handled. With a separate administrator account, `config-base` writes a root outside the home folder into `workharbor`'s configuration, which the administrator's host run cannot read, so nobody creates the folder: the known open question of the configuration location. Real-disk behaviour of these commands on an external volume is {{< status unverified >}}.

**The admin record** (issue #431, provisional). The full configuration stays in the whr account's home, `$HOME/.config/whr/config.json`. The host step `admin-record` additionally publishes a small file for the administrator at a fixed place, `/etc/whr/admin.json`, whatever the install prefix is and wherever `whr` lies (alpha policy, issue #493): `version`, `user` (the whr account), `workspaces` (the workspace roots) and `dashboard_port` (the port of `listen`). Nothing else is copied: the record is built from these fields by name, so no token path, key file or other configuration key can reach it, and no secret is ever in it. `whr setup host` installs it like the sshd drop-in, as two `sudo install` commands shown first: the directory `/etc/whr` (`root:wheel`, `0755`) and the file (`root:wheel`, `0644`) from a private temporary file; `/etc` is a link to `/private/etc` on macOS and `install` follows it. The check compares the file with what the configuration would give, so a second run changes nothing; it is never a `FAIL`: a missing or stale record is a `warn` that says writing it needs root, because it is a convenience, not a security property. On a single-account install without `sudo` the step therefore only warns and the record stays unwritten. `--dry-run` prints the record in the plan. Like `workspace-folders`, it reads `config.json` of the account that runs `whr setup host`, so with a separate administrator account it is reported as not reachable until that read is solved (the open question above). Without the file the check is `not_verified` and names the same remedy as `workspace-folders` (`whr setup --only config-base`, run as the whr account). The location, the modes and ownership on a real host, the link handling of `/etc`, and a run without `sudo` are {{< status unverified >}}; only the unit tests ran.

**`whr doctor`** runs every one of those checks, read-only: it never fixes, asks or runs `sudo`. It prints the host steps, the user steps and the shared checks, and on each failing or `not_verified` line it names the command that fixes it, for example `→ whr setup host --only power`; the same command is the fourth tab-separated column on stdout (`fix` with `--json`). The user steps describe the account `whr` runs as, so run as any other account (`--user`, default `workharbor`) they say `not_verified` and "run `whr doctor` as `workharbor`"; `--skip` leaves out any check or step by name. This is {{< status unverified >}} on the reference Mac mini until issue #73.

**What the output looks like** (issue #320). `whr setup` and `whr doctor` print for a person on stderr, with three kinds of text that always look the same. A *report* says what whr checked: a symbol, a status word (`ok`, `FAIL`, `?` for not verified, `WARN`, `skip`) and one reason line, so the same fact is never printed as status, heading and detail. An *ACTION* is anything you must do or answer: a bar and the label `ACTION`. A *command* sits under it after a `$`, indented, ready to copy. Each setup step starts with a header line, `── Step n of N ─ title ──` (`-- Step n of N - title --` in plain ASCII); a legend comes first, and the end has a one-line summary and a numbered list, "What you need to do now". Colour and non-ASCII symbols appear only on a terminal, with `TERM` not `dumb`, without `NO_COLOR`, `--no-color` and `--plain`; `FORCE_COLOR` or `--color=always` force colour on explicitly; the words and symbols are always there, so nothing depends on colour. The raw text of the tools whr ran (for example `defaults` or `dscl` errors) is shown only with `--verbose`, and what a fix command prints is indented apart under "tool output". On a terminal, `whr doctor` leaves the tab-separated data lines off stdout, because the report says the same; piped, they are unchanged, and `--json` is byte-for-byte the same either way. Questions read `[Y/n/q]` (Enter is yes) for steps that can be undone, and `[y/N/q]` (Enter is no) for steps that cannot; `q` stops with the command that resumes and exit code 8, which is neither success nor failure. Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or a deadline stops the run with exit code 9 (interrupted), at once while a check or a command runs; at a `[Y/n/q]` question the terminal waits for Enter first, and the run stops after it; no later step starts, and the resume command names the step that was cut short (its check or its fix), so it is checked again, or the next step when none had started. This rendering has not been tried in the author's own terminal (fsh) {{< status unverified >}}.

**Closing summary, backups and `--yes`** (issue #381, provisional). `whr setup` and `whr offboard host --delete` end with what changed, the ACTION lines for what you still must do, and the path of the run log. Before whr replaces the configuration, it saves the old file as `config.json.bak` (`0600`, an older backup is replaced) and prints that path. `whr setup --yes` answers `[Y/n/q]` questions about steps that can be undone with yes; it still asks every `[y/N/q]` question and "Done with this step?", and `sudo` still asks for its password. `whr offboard` has no `--yes`, and the account is removed only with `--delete` and the typed word. {{< status unverified >}}

**The automatic log-out step.** The step reports `ok` when `defaults read` for `com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay` fails with exactly one of two messages, each as the whole error text: "The domain/default pair of (/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences, com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay) does not exist", or "Could not find key 'com.apple.autologout.AutoLogOutDelay' in domain 'kCFPreferencesAnyApplication'". Either may follow an optional `defaults[pid:tid]` timestamp header line, which `defaults` prints first (observed on one Mac running macOS 26.6.2), and may start with `Error: ` and end with a full stop, as `defaults` prints it on the reference Mac (exit status 1, verified there). An absent key means automatic log-out is off, so the manual step needs nothing more. A value of plain digits is `ok` when zero and a failure otherwise; a value that is not plain digits and any other error or extra text stay `not_verified`. That the default is off on every macOS 26 is {{< status unverified >}}.

Secrets are only ever generated or typed without echo, written `0600` with an exclusive create, never overwritten and never printed. What the wizard cannot do (enabling FileVault, the App's confirm click and installation, the ruleset check, signing in to Tailscale) it says, opens the right System Settings pane or link where it can, and checks afterwards. All of the wizard's commands and the output formats it reads are {{< status unverified >}} until it has set up the reference Mac mini (issue #73).

**Answers and the setup protocol** (issue #337, provisional). `whr setup` (the user part only) can keep your answers and replay them. `--save-answers FILE` writes the `run` or `skip` you gave to each step that a file may decide; `--answers FILE` reads such a file, so those steps do not ask the outer "Ready to run this?" question again. Both take only a path you name: there is no default location, and `~/.config/whr/` is a good place. `--save-answers` checks the path before the run and never overwrites: an existing file stops the run at the start, so remove it first. The file is `0600`, must be yours and not writable by others (a readable one loads with a warning), lies outside any git working tree and holds decisions only: per step the id, the sha256 of the exact command and `run` or `skip`, bound to the whr build and the account that saved it. A changed command, another build, another account or a build without a commit identity (a dirty source build neither saves nor uses a file) means the step is asked again. A password, token or key is never stored: a fix that asks for one still asks. Host steps (`whr setup host` takes none of these flags), steps that use `sudo`, guided steps and irreversible ones are never answered from a file, and a `sudo` command that a step builds at run time is asked first even when the file says `run`. Questions inside a fix and "Open it now?" stay interactive. `--dry-run --answers FILE` shows, per step, whether the file would run or skip it or the question stays open and why. `--unattended` (user part, needs `--answers`, no terminal needed) asks nothing: it runs what the file decides, leaves every other step for you and exits with code 6 when any is left. A file in your account is an index of decisions, not proof: anything that can write it can also run `whr`.

Every `whr setup` and `whr setup host` run that is not a dry run appends to the setup protocol, `~/.local/state/whr/setup-protocol.jsonl` of the account that runs it (the administrator for `whr setup host`, `workharbor` for `whr setup`), one JSON line per event: the run start with the resume flags (home shown as `~`), per step what was decided (`interactive` or `answers`, with the digest of the file) before its fix runs, and its outcome with the digest of the commands that ran and the exit status, then the run end. It is created `0600`, never rewritten or rotated, and holds no command text, output, password, token or key. Each line carries the digest of the one before, so an edit in the middle shows; but whoever runs as the same user can rewrite the whole file, so it records what a run decided and did and proves nothing against that user. If a line cannot be written, the run stops before it changes anything more. `whr setup history` will read it later (not built yet).

**The run log** (issue #379). Every `whr setup`, `whr setup host`, `whr offboard host` and `whr doctor` run writes a text log (the default log is not written when you run as root or when `HOME` is not an absolute path; give `--log-file` then) of the commands it ran: per command the argv, the exit code and the output, and per step one line `step <name>: ok|fail|unknown <reason>`. The default is a new file per run, `~/.local/state/whr/logs/<command>-<UTC time>.log` (for example `setup-20261007T101500Z.log`), in a `0700` directory and `0600` itself; `--log-file <path>` writes there instead (appending if it exists) and `--verbose` also streams the records to the terminal. A failed step shows its cause, the next command, the last lines of its output and the log path; the path is also the last line of every run. The log never holds a password: whr reads it itself and hands it to the tool on stdin, a tool's prompt for a secret is dropped, and a secret value a tool echoes is masked. A `--log-file` must be a plain file with one name: a symlink, a hard link, a FIFO or a device is refused (exit 2), and as root a file owned by someone else is refused too. As root the parent directory must also be owned by root and not writable by group or others, so a `--log-file` in `/tmp` or in a directory owned by another user is refused (exit 2); use a directory root owns, such as `/var/root`. Following a run from a second terminal (or a tmux pane) is one line: `whr setup --log-file ~/whr-setup.log` in the first, `tail -f ~/whr-setup.log` in the second. Untried on the reference Mac mini {{< status unverified >}}.

## 1. Hardware and macOS

- An Apple-silicon Mac mini. **Recommended: M6 with 32 GB memory and 512 GB storage**, for about ten concurrent agent environments. **On a budget: 16 GB**, for about four, with 512 GB or with 256 GB plus an external SSD. 24 GB / 512 GB sits in between, for about six (D32, [design §8](../design/architecture.md#8-resources)).

  | M6 configuration | US price, 1 October 2026 | Environments (estimate) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 16 GB / 256 GB, budget with an external SSD | $899 | about 4 |
  | 16 GB / 512 GB, budget | $1,099 | about 4 |
  | 24 GB / 512 GB | $1,299 | about 6 |
  | **32 GB / 512 GB** | **$1,499** | **about 10** |

  Each memory step costs $200 and adds about four environments; prices change, so check the Apple Store for your country (Germany: from €1,049).
- Spend on memory before storage: memory cannot be upgraded later, storage can be added externally. An external SSD holds repositories, workspaces and backups well; whether Apple Container's own storage (images, volumes with the agents' build caches) can live there is {{< status unverified >}} (issue #54).
- Use the macOS version you are running (unverified): whr's commands and their output formats were not checked against a specific macOS version, and the Apple Container measurements were made on macOS 26.6.2.
- Keep automatic security updates on, but **install macOS updates that restart the Mac yourself**: a restart stops every running agent until the supervisor resumes them.

## 2. Users

- Use your own administrator account for setup only: Homebrew, `sudo`, system settings. Each step below says which account runs it.
- Pick the account WorkHarbor runs as (D49; any account but `root`; `whr doctor`'s `account` check reports which of these you have, and `whr setup` asks once whether the account is `dedicated` or `shared`, which it writes as `account` in the configuration):
    - **A dedicated standard user `workharbor` (recommended).** Agents never run next to your own home directory, keychain or SSH keys, and nothing running as `workharbor` can install software or use `sudo`. This is the only account that `whr doctor` passes with `ok`.
    - **A dedicated administrator.** Setup is easier, because one account runs `whr setup host` and then `whr setup`; the risk is that an escape from the supervisor, or whoever drives it, holds `sudo` and writes to `/Applications` and the Homebrew prefix. `whr doctor` says `warn`, and `fail` when the configuration also makes whr reachable from other devices (a `public_url`, the console's SSH, or the Mac's own Remote Login or Screen Sharing being on). After setup, the last optional step `drop-admin` removes the account from the `admin` group (`sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d <user> -t user admin`, then `sudo -k`); it refuses when no other administrator exists, so you are never locked out; log out and back in or restart afterwards, because processes that already run keep the group until then ({{< status unverified >}}).
    - **Your own account on a dual-use Mac (`account: shared`).** No setup at all, at the price of everything above plus your keychain, SSH keys and forge logins sitting next to whr's secrets and the supervisor's token and socket, which every process you run can reach. `whr doctor` says `warn` (or `fail` with remote access), `whr setup` asks one explicit `y` that names the risk when the check would fail, and `drop-admin` is never offered. Threat T18 has the reasons.
- **`whr` needs a desktop login session**, not only SSH. Apple Container registers its services in the logged-in user's GUI launchd domain (`gui/<uid>`), and its state lives in that user's `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.container`: a shell from SSH, `sudo -u workharbor` or `su workharbor` cannot start or reach them. So log in as `workharbor` on the Mac (or over Screen Sharing), start what step 6 and step 13 start from a Terminal in that session, and leave the session logged in; use fast user switching to reach your own account. Commands that do not touch containers (files, the configuration, `whr tools build`) also work from `sudo -iu workharbor`.
- **Keep that session logged in.** Turn off automatic log-out (*System Settings → Privacy & Security → Advanced → Log out automatically after inactivity*): a log-out ends Apple Container's services and every agent with them. A locked screen is fine; the session and its services keep running. Automatic login is not an option, because it needs FileVault off (step 3). `whr doctor` reads this setting from the system preferences; a delay that a managed (MDM) profile sets is not read, and a read that fails is reported as not verified, never as passing {{< status unverified >}}.
- Whether Apple Container runs for a **standard (non-administrator) user** is {{< status unverified >}}: the services are per user, but nobody has tried it on a fresh standard account yet. Check it once in step 6; if it fails, tell us in issue #38 before you make `workharbor` an administrator (D49 allows it).

```bash
# as the administrator; you are asked for a password
sudo sysadminctl -addUser workharbor -fullName "WorkHarbor" -password -
```

The record name (the short name) stays lowercase `workharbor`; only the full name shown at the login window is set as `WorkHarbor` ({{< status unverified >}} on macOS 26).

The default service account is `workharbor`. The host account step is named
`workharbor-user`; its title, account-creation command and login guidance use
the account selected with `--user`. Login guidance and doctor repair commands
retain `--user` for a nondefault account. The old `whr-user` step name remains an
input alias for `whr setup host --only`, `--from` and `whr doctor --skip`; output and
completion use `workharbor-user`. Existing installations can keep their
current nonroot account, including `whr`, by passing `--user <account>` to
`whr setup` and `whr doctor` (for example, `whr doctor --user whr`, where `whr` is the legacy account name from before D49). When the `workharbor-user` check runs for the default account, finds no `workharbor` but does find a `whr` account, it says so and names `whr setup host --user whr` and `whr doctor --user whr` as the next step instead of offering `sysadminctl -addUser` for a second account (an account you name with `--user` is never redirected); it only counts `whr` as missing on a real "not found" answer from `dscl`, and any other answer stays not verified ({{< status unverified >}} on macOS 26). The selected
account uses its actual host home directory. This change does not rename an
account, move a home directory, change ownership or UID/GID, or migrate volumes,
credentials or keys. Plan any existing-installation migration separately.

The host step `login-picture` gives the account the Workharbor logo as its login picture (`whr setup host --only login-picture`). It installs a bundled 256x256 PNG, embedded in the binary and never downloaded, as `/Library/User Pictures/Workharbor/logo.png` (owner `root`, so the account cannot replace it) and sets the account's `Picture` attribute to that path with `sudo dscl . -create /Users/workharbor Picture <path>`; it does nothing when the attribute and the file already match, and the step is skipped (never creates a record) until the account exists. Verified on a Mac, read-only: `Picture` holds a file path and `JPEGPhoto` is empty on an account with the default picture. {{< status unverified >}}: that `dscl -create Picture` is accepted without a GUI and that the login window then shows the image (one real-host run is needed); the `JPEGPhoto` binary attribute is not used.

To delete the account again, see [Remove the WorkHarbor account](#remove-the-workharbor-account).

## 3. FileVault and restarts

Keep **FileVault on**. That rules out automatic login, which is the right trade-off for a machine that holds agent logins.

- **An external SSD is not covered by FileVault.** Encrypt it on its own, as the administrator: erase it as *APFS (Encrypted)* in Disk Utility, or encrypt an existing APFS volume with `diskutil apfs encryptVolume /Volumes/<ssd> -user disk` (it asks for a passphrase; keep it in your password manager). When `workharbor` first unlocks it, tick *Remember this password in my keychain*, so it mounts when `workharbor` logs in; before that login it stays locked, which matches FileVault's behaviour after a restart. macOS ignores file ownership on external volumes by default, which would let every account write to the workspaces: turn it on with `sudo diskutil enableOwnership /Volumes/<ssd>` and check *Get Info → Ignore ownership on this volume* is off. The keychain mount at login and the ownership default are {{< status unverified >}} on macOS 26.
- **Planned restarts:** `sudo fdesetup authrestart` restarts once without the unlock prompt.
- **After a power cut:** the Mac stops at the FileVault unlock screen. Nobody is logged in yet, so the Tailscale app (step 7) is not running and Screen Sharing is not available: unlock it with a keyboard and display, then log in as `workharbor` so its services start. Whether macOS 26 accepts a remote unlock over SSH at that screen is {{< status unverified >}}. A small UPS makes this rare.
- **Tailscale and a reboot:** the cask app is a login item, so it starts only after someone logs in. With FileVault on and no automatic login, the host is unreachable through Tailscale after a reboot until someone logs in {{< status unverified >}}. The Homebrew formula `tailscale` can run `tailscaled` as a system daemon that starts at boot instead; that is an alternative (it replaces the app) and whr does not install or check it {{< status unverified >}}.
- **WorkHarbor runs as a LaunchAgent of `workharbor`, never a LaunchDaemon** (issue #38): Apple Container's services are in `workharbor`'s GUI launchd domain, so a daemon cannot reach them. `whr service install` (step 13) loads it, and it starts again at every login of `workharbor`. So after a power cut, one login as `workharbor` brings the supervisor, Apple Container and the agents back. Loading and restarting it was measured on the developer's own account ({{< status verified >}}, 2 October 2026, macOS with `container` 1.5.0); that it also works for the standard user `workharbor` and after a real reboot is {{< status unverified >}} (issue #73).

## 4. Power

A sleeping Mac pauses every agent.

```bash
sudo pmset -a sleep 0 disksleep 0 autorestart 1 womp 1 powernap 0
```

`autorestart 1` starts the Mac after a power cut; `womp 1` lets it wake on a Wake-on-LAN magic packet; `powernap 0` turns Power Nap off, which on a headless Mac only wakes it for background work. That Power Nap is behind spikes on a headless Mac is {{< status unverified >}}; the `power` step of `whr setup host` and `whr doctor` checks and sets all five values in one `sudo pmset -a` command.

### A headless Mac: Apple's background analysis

Werner's headless Mac was measured with `mediaanalysisd` (Apple's media analysis) at 222 % CPU (21:35 of CPU time, load about 4) while it ran agent environments (Werner's own observation, with no committed measurement: {{< status unverified >}}, as are its cause and the remedies below). Two steps look at it, and neither kills, deletes or disables anything of Apple's:

- `media-analysis` reads `mediaanalysisd`'s CPU use and CPU time (`ps`) and the size of its cache under the `workharbor` user's `~/Library/Caches` (`du`). It fails at 50 % of a core or more, a threshold picked from that one measurement, and passes when the process is not running. Its fix is guided: turn off Apple Intelligence and Siri (System Settings, the Siri pane the step opens), and keep Photos' analysis from running. Whether that stops the process on macOS 26 is {{< status unverified >}}.
- `spotlight` reads `mdutil -s` for each workspace root that is on a volume of its own and fails while indexing is on; its fix, shown first and run after your `y`, is `sudo mdutil -i off <volume>`. A root on the internal disk cannot be handled that way, and Spotlight's privacy list cannot be read, so the step stays not verified and you add the root yourself under System Settings, Spotlight, Search Privacy. That this stops the background work is {{< status unverified >}}.

Two stopgaps are manual only, because the OS undoes them and they are not idempotent: deleting `~/Library/Caches/com.apple.mediaanalysisd`, and `killall mediaanalysisd` (launchd starts it again). `whr` never runs either. Their effect is {{< status unverified >}} until the verifier has measured `mediaanalysisd`'s CPU and the load before and after the steps (issue #150).

## 5. Software (Homebrew)

**As the administrator.** Homebrew's prefix `/opt/homebrew` belongs to the account that installed it, so `whr` cannot install, upgrade or pin anything; it only runs what is installed. `whr setup host --only homebrew` installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) when `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` is missing (issue #505): it downloads Homebrew's `install.sh` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh` to a private file (mode 0600 in a private temporary directory, removed afterwards), prints the file's path, the URL and the script's SHA-256, then asks you to confirm before it runs the script as you (`/usr/bin/env NONINTERACTIVE=1 /bin/bash <file>`, after one `sudo -v`; the script's own `sudo` calls use that ticket and are not shown one by one). The hash is informational, not a pin: the script is trusted by TLS alone, so read it first (`less <file>`). The confirmation is always asked: `--yes` does not answer it and `--unattended` leaves the step for you. A failed download is reported and nothing runs. The step works for a single account that is its own administrator (the script itself refuses `root`). The Command Line Tools stay guided: install them yourself (`xcode-select --install`, for `make`; it opens a dialog on the Mac's screen). Then `brew-packages` installs the host packages from a `Brewfile`. On a Mac with no Command Line Tools, Homebrew or `gh`, whether the script finishes headless, which Command Line Tools prompt appears, and who owns `/opt/homebrew` afterwards are {{< status unverified >}}; so is the real download. Keep Homebrew from upgrading anything you did not ask for: `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` stops the automatic index refresh, `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE` stops `brew install` from upgrading what is installed, and `brew pin` (step 6) holds a version through `brew upgrade`.

```bash
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE=1' >> ~/.zprofile
```

```ruby
# Brewfile: the whole host software for workharbor (D28)
brew "container"      # Apple Container; workharbor was measured with 1.5.0
brew "git"
brew "gh"             # downloads and verifies whr's draft releases (step 13) until v0.1.0
cask "tailscale-app" # only for the Tailscale option in step 7
# tap "wstein/tap"; brew "whr"   # from v0.1.0 (issue #62); until then step 13
```

```bash
brew bundle --file=Brewfile
brew pin container    # hold the version you tested through brew upgrade
```

`whr` finds these through its `PATH`: as `workharbor`, add `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` to `~/.zprofile`.

Do **not** install Claude Code, Codex CLI or other agent CLIs on the host for WorkHarbor. WorkHarbor fetches them into its own verified tool store and mounts them into each environment read-only (D19).

## 6. Apple Container

**As `workharbor`, in a Terminal of its desktop session** (step 2), start the container system, install the Linux kernel the containers boot once, and check it:

```bash
container system start --disable-kernel-install
container system kernel set --recommended
container system status
launchctl print gui/$(id -u) | grep com.apple.container   # the services run in this session
container list --all                                     # answers without an error
```

`--disable-kernel-install` skips the interactive kernel prompt, which is why the kernel is installed in its own step; `container system kernel set` needs the running system (it fails with `XPC connection error` before the start), and without a kernel no container starts. `whr setup` runs the steps in this order and says at its end when no kernel is installed. The last two lines are the standard-user check of step 2: if `container system start` or `container list` fails with a permission or bootstrap error, note the message in issue #38. After a restart the system does not start by itself; the WorkHarbor LaunchAgent (step 13) runs `container system start --disable-kernel-install` in `workharbor`'s session before it starts the supervisor, which then resumes the agents.

### Over SSH

Over SSH, use the `whr` CLI; never run `container` directly. `whr ls`, `whr show <task>` and `whr logs` are clients of the API and need no session check. `whr doctor` runs its checks locally, apart from one probe of the API (the supervisor-token check). `whr service status` and `whr service install` refuse over SSH (they check that the shell is in the graphical login session): run them in the desktop session (Screen Sharing). `container` commands and `whr setup` need `workharbor`'s desktop session, because Apple Container's services live in that user's GUI launchd domain and an SSH login is in another one, where `container system status` fails with `XPC connection error: Connection invalid` even while the services run {{< status unverified >}} (upstream apple/container#205; to be measured in #155). Over SSH, `whr doctor` therefore reports the three checks that call `container` (the kernel, the container system and the standard-user check) as `not_verified`; run them in the desktop session (Screen Sharing).

## 7. Reach it from your phone

The web UI of WorkHarbor listens on **loopback only** (`listen`), and the JSON API is not on the network at all: it is served on a unix socket, `api.sock` in the state directory (`~/.local/state/whr`, a `0700` directory), which only `workharbor`'s own account can open, so the `whr` commands work in `workharbor`'s session and a leaked API token is no use from the phone (D29). Sign-in to the web UI is by passkey once one is enrolled. A guest container reaches anything on the Mac's LAN address or on all interfaces, even from an isolated network, but not loopback ({{< status verified >}} in [the host-reachability spike](../spikes/host-reachability.md), issue #69). Your phone reaches WorkHarbor through a forwarder. Pick one option.

### Option A: Tailscale (default)

The quickest option. The Mac gets its own VPN interface and a stable name, and Tailscale can issue HTTPS certificates for that name, which the phone app (PWA) needs.

1. Install the Tailscale app on the Mac (step 5, as the administrator) and on the phone. Sign in on the Mac **in `workharbor`'s session**, the one that stays logged in; whether the app keeps the Mac on the VPN while no one or another user is logged in is {{< status unverified >}}.
2. As `workharbor`, forward the Mac's Tailscale name to WorkHarbor on loopback with HTTPS: `tailscale serve --bg <port>` (check the exact syntax with `tailscale serve --help`). WorkHarbor itself stays on loopback.
3. Optional: limit the phone to that port with a Tailscale access rule.
4. Whether a guest container can reach the Mac's Tailscale address is {{< status unverified >}} (issue #69); the API token guards it either way.

Tailscale's coordination server is a third party. [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) replaces it with a self-hosted one.

### Option B: WireGuard on your router (FRITZ!Box)

No VPN software on the Mac and no third party. A FRITZ!Box offers WireGuard from FRITZ!OS 7.50 ({{< status unverified >}}: check your version).

1. On the FRITZ!Box: *Internet → Permit Access → VPN (WireGuard)*, add a connection for your phone, and import it into the WireGuard app with the QR code.
2. The phone then reaches the Mac at its LAN address. There is no VPN interface on the Mac, so the address alone does not tell your phone from any other device on the LAN.
3. So WorkHarbor stays on loopback, and a small HTTPS proxy on the Mac's LAN address forwards to it. Guest containers can reach that proxy too, so a `pf` packet-filter rule admits only the addresses the FRITZ!Box gives VPN clients to its port, and the API token guards every request. The macOS firewall in System Settings cannot do this: it filters by app, not by address. The `pf` rule and how the FRITZ!Box numbers VPN clients are {{< status unverified >}} (issue #69): check the address your phone gets.
4. The phone app needs HTTPS: use your own certificate authority (installed on the phone) or a certificate for a domain you own.

A line without a public IPv4 address (DS-Lite, carrier-grade NAT) may not accept inbound WireGuard ({{< status unverified >}}); Tailscale works there.

### Option C: WireGuard on the Mac

A VPN interface like Tailscale's, without a third party, but you forward a UDP port on the router to the Mac and manage keys yourself. Choose it only if you need both properties.

## 8. Firewall and SSH

- macOS firewall on, in stealth mode: *System Settings → Network → Firewall*.
- **Every guest container can reach the Mac's services that listen on all interfaces**, even from an isolated network (issue #69). Turn off what you do not need in *System Settings → General → Sharing* (File Sharing, Screen Sharing, AirPlay Receiver, Media Sharing).
- Remote Login (SSH) only for your administrator account (*Allow access for*), with **keys only**: set `PasswordAuthentication no` and `KbdInteractiveAuthentication no` in a file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/`. Otherwise an agent could guess passwords. The short-lived SSH certificates of WorkHarbor are for the console only; they do not replace this, and SSH to the host stays key-only.
- A `pf` rule that blocks the container subnets (`192.168.64.0/24` for the default network, and the `--internal` networks') from the Mac's own addresses closes this for every service; it is {{< status unverified >}} and comes with issue #69.
- Screen Sharing over the VPN works once a user is logged in; it does not reach the FileVault unlock screen (step 3). It is how you reach `workharbor`'s desktop session from afar (step 2); if you keep it on, allow it only for your administrator and `workharbor`, and it stays reachable from guests until the `pf` rule above exists.
- **Headless is fine.** After setup the Mac runs without a display, keyboard or mouse, and you reach it over SSH and Screen Sharing. Without a display attached, Screen Sharing may offer only a low resolution; an HDMI dummy plug fixes that ({{< status unverified >}} on macOS 26). Keep a display and keyboard at hand for the FileVault unlock after a power cut (step 3).
- From SSH as the administrator, `sudo -iu workharbor` gives a `workharbor` shell for files and builds, but not for `container` or `whr serve` (step 2).
- **Only the administrator logs in to the host, and only for administration** (macOS and `whr` upgrades, recovery). Your daily shell work, in the workspaces and across them, goes through the console instead: `whr console` opens a shell in a VM with git, zsh, fish, `ripgrep`, `tmux`, `make` and an editor, every workspace mounted read-only, behind the same egress allowlist as the agents (the package registries and `github.com` for reads, never the model API), with none of your credentials or the agents'. `whr console <workspace>` starts in that workspace; `whr console <workspace> --write` mounts that one workspace read-write, which you want when you edit, and needs the console closed first if it was opened with other writable workspaces (`whr console --close`; its home, with your dotfiles and history, is kept). `git` in the console ignores the hooks, filters, aliases and other commands that a workspace's configuration sets, because agents write that configuration. The shell comes through `whr` and the token on the private socket of the supervisor; it is not reachable from the phone or through the web UI. The first console builds its image, which takes a while.
- **SSH into the console (issue #32).** `whr ssh` opens an SSH session in the console, never on the host, and `whr ssh --config` prints a `Host whr-console` block for `~/.ssh/config` so that VS Code Remote-SSH and JetBrains can use it. Turn it on once: run `whr setup` (its optional `ssh-ca` step makes the authority key, a `0600` file in the configuration directory) and add `"console": {"ssh_ca_key_file": "<that path>"}` to the configuration. Your key stays on the machine you run `whr` on; each connection gets a certificate for it that lasts minutes (a certificate that still has four minutes left is reused, so a connection does not sign twice), for the user `workharbor` only, and the console's host key is pinned from `whr`, so nothing is trusted on first sight and nothing needs renewing by hand. The console listens on no port: SSH is carried over the same API as `whr console`, so it is reachable exactly as far as that is, and the `ssh` client must be installed where you run `whr ssh`. Port forwarding, which the editors' remote modes need, is off unless you pass `--forward`, and then reaches only the console's own loopback. Losing the authority key means anyone holding it can sign a certificate, so it is a secret like the API token: back it up the same way, and if it leaks, delete the file, run the step again and restart `whr serve`.

## 9. Backups

- Follow the one procedure in [Back up, upgrade and restore](install-upgrade-release.md#back-up-upgrade-and-restore): it names the configuration directory (`~/.config/whr`), the state directory (the database with its `-wal` and `-shm` files), the secret files (encrypted backup only) and the workspace folders, and says to stop `whr serve` first.
- **Exclude the container volumes and images** from Time Machine and every other backup. The agent-home volumes hold the agents' sessions and subscription logins, which no `whr` procedure copies (D40); a restore means signing in again. Images are rebuilt, and volumes grow sparsely (issue #54).

## 10. Phone notifications (optional)

WorkHarbor does not create the topic: you do, as the `workharbor` user, and tell the configuration where it is ([design §9.4](../design/interfaces.md#94-notifications)). On ntfy.sh the topic is the only thing that keeps your channel private, so make it long and random:

```sh
umask 077
mkdir -p ~/.config/whr && chmod 700 ~/.config/whr
openssl rand -hex 16 > ~/.config/whr/ntfy.topic     # 32 characters
```

Each secret file must be `0600`, owned by you, absolute, a regular file with one link, not empty, and outside every workspace and root WorkHarbor trusts. An optional token file (for a server that needs an access token) follows the same rules. Add the block to the configuration (step 13):

```json
"ntfy": {
  "server": "https://ntfy.sh",
  "topic_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/ntfy.topic",
  "token_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/ntfy.token"
}
```

- `server` is optional and defaults to `https://ntfy.sh`. It must be an `https` URL, or `http` on `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` for a server on the same host, and it carries no username, password, query or fragment (keep the token in the token file).
- `topic_file` is required. The topic in it needs at least 20 characters and no `/`, `?`, `#` or whitespace (surrounding whitespace is trimmed).
- `token_file` is optional.
- A notification links to the task, so `public_url` (or `board.public_url`) must be set to an `https` URL, as in step 13.

`whr serve` refuses to start when any of this is wrong, and says which key. Then install the [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) app and subscribe to that topic on your server. A notification carries only a task ID, an event kind and a link; the link needs the VPN from step 7. Pushes are limited per task: an identical message (same task, kind, decision and run) sent within an hour is dropped, and a task sends at most 5 pushes an hour. What is dropped is still in the inbox. That the configuration is validated and the throttle works is tested; delivery to a real ntfy server and the app on a phone have not been measured ({{< status unverified >}}).

## 11. The GitHub App

WorkHarbor talks to GitHub as an App of your own, never with your personal token (D15, D31): its tokens last about an hour, cover one repository and only the permissions below, and the App cannot merge, tag or release. On github.com, as the repository's owner:

**The quick way: `whr github app create`** (provisional name). It creates the App from a manifest, so there is no form to fill in and no `.pem` to download. You need the `listen` and `api_token_file` lines of the configuration (step 13) and the HTTPS name your forwarder gives WorkHarbor (step 7), which belongs in the configuration as `public_url`: `whr setup` asks for it (the `public-url` step) and writes it after a `y`. Type the host name only, for example `whr.example.ts.net`: `https://` is added when it is missing, the host is lower-cased and a trailing slash is dropped. An explicit `http://`, a path, a user name, a query, a space or a port outside 1 to 65535 is refused, because GitHub sends the browser to this name; `whr` does not guess it, since reading a Tailscale name would need the network. `whr serve` must not be running, because the supervisor needs the App this creates.

```bash
whr github app create
```

`--public-url <name>` overrides `public_url` for one run. To try the flow on the Mac itself, without any forwarder, run `whr github app create --local` and open the link, `http://127.0.0.1:8787/...`, in a browser on this Mac; GitHub redirecting a browser back to a loopback address is {{< status unverified >}} on a real host.

**If the link times out.** The command listens on loopback only (`listen`, default `127.0.0.1:8787`), and the forwarder of step 7 must map your HTTPS name to that port (`tailscale serve`). The macOS application firewall (`/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate`, which needs no `sudo`) does not filter a connection to loopback, so it cannot be why `http://127.0.0.1:8787` fails on this Mac; a link that times out points at the name or the forwarder: a name the device cannot resolve (MagicDNS or `.local` names need the VPN or the same network), or a forwarder that is not serving. `whr doctor` reports `public-url`: it checks the configuration and the listener and reads the firewall state, and says plainly that it does not check the forwarder ({{< status unverified >}} on a real host).

1. It prints a link and waits on the configuration's `listen` address. Open the link on any device that reaches that name (the Mac or the phone, over the VPN of step 7) and press **Continue to GitHub**. GitHub shows the App's name and asks you to confirm: **Create GitHub App**. For an organization's App, add `--org <name>`; you must own the organization.
2. GitHub sends the browser back to WorkHarbor with a one-time code. Only a link this command just made is accepted, once, and for ten minutes (`--ttl`); anything else is refused. `whr` exchanges the code for the App and writes the private key to `~/.config/whr/github-app-<id>.pem` (mode `0600`, never overwriting a file). The key, the client secret and the webhook secret are never printed or logged; the two secrets are dropped.
3. The command prints the two lines to add to the configuration, `"github": {"app_id": <id>, "key_file": "<path>"}`: it does not edit the file. It also prints the link to install the App. Install it as in step 3 below, and check the ruleset as in step 4. The App is private, has no active webhook and only the permissions below.
4. `whr doctor` then checks, from GitHub, that the App is installed on every configured repository with exactly those permissions.

Whether GitHub accepts the manifest as `workharbor` sends it (its inactive webhook, a private App) is {{< status unverified >}} until the first run against github.com. **If it does not work, or you prefer to click, create the App by hand** with the steps below:

1. **Create the App.** Your account's **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**.
    - **Name:** for example `workharbor-<your-name>` (it must be unique on GitHub). **Homepage URL:** the repository's URL.
    - **Webhook:** untick **Active**. `whr` asks GitHub when it needs something; webhooks would need a public address, which WorkHarbor does not have (D29).
    - **Repository permissions:** Contents **Read and write**, Issues **Read and write**, Pull requests **Read and write**; Metadata stays **Read-only**. Nothing else: without the Workflows permission the App cannot change `.github/workflows`, and without Administration it cannot change rulesets.
    - **Where can this GitHub App be installed:** **Only on this account**.
    - **Create GitHub App**, then note the **App ID** on its General page.
2. **Generate a private key** on the same page (**Private keys → Generate a private key**). The browser downloads a `.pem` file: that file is the secret, see step 12.
3. **Install it** (**Install App**) on your account with **Only select repositories** and pick the repositories WorkHarbor works on. `whr` finds the installation by itself. **One App serves all your repositories**: to add one later, add it to the installation's repository list and to `repositories` in the configuration; each token `whr` mints still covers one repository only. Repositories of an organization need the App installed there too, which takes **Any account** in step 1, or a second App owned by the organization.
4. **Check the ruleset of `main`** (the repository's **Settings → Rules → Rulesets**): changes need a pull request with a human review, force pushes are blocked, and the App is **not** in the bypass list (D15). The supervisor pushes only `agent/*` branches and opens pull requests; merging stays with you.

    **Which ruleset each workflow needs** (D47; set per repository in the configuration as `"workflow"`, default `integration`; `whr doctor` checks it as `forge-workflow`):

    | Workflow | Where approved commits go | The ruleset to set up |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `prototype` | the supervisor fast-forwards the integration branch (`integration_branch`, required, and never the default branch) to the approved commit; no pull request | two rulesets. On the integration branch: force pushes blocked, and only the App and you may write to it ({{< status unverified >}}: whether a ruleset can name the App as the only other writer). On the default branch: a ruleset that targets `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` (not the branch's name, and with no excluded refs, so it follows a change of default) and restricts updates or requires a pull request, with the App **not** a bypass actor; you promote through a bypass of your own or a pull request (`whr doctor` reports a missing rule or an App bypass as a failure, and a ruleset that excludes refs, or whose bypass list or targets GitHub does not show this App, as "not verified": {{< status unverified >}} whether it shows them) |
    | `integration` (default) | a pull request into `integration_branch` (default `develop`) that you merge and promote to `main` | that branch protected, a pull request required |
    | `published` | a pull request into the default branch; the agent asks for every tool (`manual`) | the default branch requires a pull request with a review and status checks and signed commits, and has **no bypass actor** |

    Whether the App's token can read these rulesets (and a ruleset's bypass list) is {{< status unverified >}}: where it cannot, `whr doctor` says "not verified", never "ok". Changing a repository's workflow in the configuration is a policy change: `whr serve` refuses to start until you confirm it with `--accept-workflow-change`, the change is recorded, and tasks already started keep the workflow they started under.

## 12. Secrets

Every secret is a file with mode `0600`, owned by the `workharbor` user, outside the workspace roots and the tool store, and the configuration names only its path. Never paste a secret into a chat, an agent session, a command line, a script or an issue: an agent never needs the value, only the path. `whr serve` refuses a secret file that is not `0600`, belongs to another user, is a link or has a second hard link, or lies inside a workspace root or the tool store.

As the `workharbor` user:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/whr && chmod 700 ~/.config/whr

# The API token the local whr CLI uses: generated, never typed.
umask 077 && openssl rand -base64 32 > ~/.config/whr/api.token

# The GitHub App's private key from step 11. `whr github app create` has already
# written it to ~/.config/whr/github-app-<id>.pem; only a key you downloaded needs moving.
mv ~/Downloads/<app-name>.*.private-key.pem ~/.config/whr/github-app.pem
chmod 600 ~/.config/whr/github-app.pem
```

**The agent's login:**

- **A subscription (Claude Pro or Max) is the default** and has no file: you sign in inside the environment with Claude Code's own login, and `whr` never sees it (design D40, [agent vendor terms](vendor-terms.md)). How that works from the console is being measured (issue #82); the first sign-in needs a Terminal in `workharbor`'s desktop session (step 2).
- **An API key is optional, and it must be an API key.** Create one in the vendor's console, not with `claude setup-token` and not a login token: `whr setup`, `whr doctor` and the configuration refuse a variable named like a subscription credential (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, any name containing `OAUTH`, `SESSION`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`, `AUTH_TOKEN`, `SETUP_TOKEN` or `LOGIN_TOKEN`), an empty or blank value, and a value shaped like a credentials file (D40, issue #348). Detecting a setup-token by its value prefix is {{< status unverified >}}: the prefix has not been measured, and the measured OAuth tokens also start with `sk-ant-` (API key prefix not recorded; {{< status unverified >}}), so no prefix is refused; only names, empty values and the credentials-file shape are. Codex and Antigravity are covered by name only. Type the key so that it is neither echoed nor kept in the shell history nor visible in the process list (`read -s` does not echo, and `printf` is a shell builtin):

  ```bash
  umask 077; read -rs KEY; printf 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=%s\n' "$KEY" > ~/.config/whr/agent.env; unset KEY
  ```

**Keys for your own experiments** (a spike, a test) live in a password manager such as `pass` or 1Password, and a script reads them from a `0600` env file named by an environment variable, never inline: the repository's hooks refuse a literal key. If a secret leaks anyway, follow the runbook in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/wstein/workharbor/blob/main/.github/SECURITY.md).

## 13. Install and configure whr (dogfood)

Until `v0.1.0` the host runs a **dogfood pre-release**: a signed prerelease tag `v0.1.0-alpha.N` on `main` that CI built and attested and that is published as a pre-release ([design D24, D34](../design/decisions.md)). Nothing is built on the host. Only pre-releases exist so far. From `v0.1.0` on, `brew install wstein/tap/whr` replaces step 1.

1. **Install, as the administrator.** The published pre-release needs only a `gh` login (a draft of a final release can be downloaded only by a writer), so this runs with your own GitHub login (`gh auth login`), never in `workharbor`'s account. The prefix belongs to the administrator, so nothing running as `workharbor`, an agent that escaped included, can replace the supervisor. If `workharbor` itself is the administrator that runs this, the prefix belongs to `root` instead (`sudo install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /opt/whr`), and `whr doctor` warns, no longer fails, about a prefix, `bin` or `bin/whr` owned by the account the supervisor runs as (D49, alpha policy #493; revisited at beta). That single-account install (the administrator account is also the whr account, no extra macOS user) is supported and not recommended {{< status unverified >}} end to end:

    ```bash
    sudo install -d -o "$(id -un)" -g admin -m 755 /opt/whr
    git clone https://github.com/wstein/workharbor.git && cd workharbor
    make install-release VERSION=<tag>    # PREFIX=/opt/whr is the default; <tag> is a release after v0.1.0-alpha.4
    ```

    From a release after `v0.1.0-alpha.4` it downloads the one release archive (macOS `whr`, guest binaries, installer) and `checksums.txt`, checks the archive against the checksums and against the build-provenance attestation of the repository's release workflow, and installs `whr` in `/opt/whr/bin` and the guest binaries `whr-shim` and `whr-proxy` in `/opt/whr/libexec/whr`; it installs nothing if a check fails. `gh release download` finds a draft by its tag ({{< status verified >}} with the first draft, `v0.1.0-alpha.1`, on an Apple-silicon Mac; issue #103). Upgrade the same way with the next tag. For `v0.1.0-alpha.4` and older, use that tag's own script (`git show <tag>:scripts/install-release.sh`). Then, as `workharbor`, add `export PATH=/opt/whr/bin:$PATH` to `~/.zprofile`: `whr version` shows the tag, and `whr completion zsh` (or `bash`, `fish`) prints the shell completion.

The remaining steps run as the `workharbor` user: steps 2 and 3 from any `workharbor` shell, step 4 from a Terminal of its desktop session (step 2).

2. **Fill the tool store.** `whr tools build -store <tool store> -shim /opt/whr/libexec/whr/whr-shim-linux-arm64` downloads Claude Code at the version pinned in the repository, checks it against the pin and the vendor's manifest, stores it read-only and adds the launcher. The build holds Claude Code only; `-tools claude,antigravity` adds Antigravity, which is checked against its pin alone (archive sha512 and extracted sha256). A checksum mismatch stops it with nothing stored. On a host that already has a `claude-<version>` profile, `-tools claude,antigravity` makes a second glibc profile, `claude-<version>-antigravity-<version>`, and `whr serve` then refuses to start ("set tool_profile") until `tool_profile` names one of them or you remove the old profile.
3. **Write the configuration file**, `~/.config/whr/config.json`. Secrets are paths (step 12), never values:

    ```json
    {
      "listen": "127.0.0.1:8787",
      "public_url": "https://<your-forwarded-name>",
      "repositories": [{ "name": "<owner>/<repository>", "integration_branch": "develop" }],
      "roots": {
        "workspaces": ["/Volumes/<ssd>/workspaces"],
        "tool_store": "/Users/workharbor/tools"
      },
      "github": { "app_id": 123456, "key_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/github-app.pem" },
      "api_token_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/api.token",
      "agent_allowed_tools": ["Read", "Edit", "Write", "Bash(git status:*)", "Bash(make check:*)"]
    }
    ```

    **More than one API caller (`api_clients`, optional).** `api_token_file` stays the client `default`. To tell further callers apart in the audit, add `"api_clients": [{"name": "ci-nightly", "token_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/ci-nightly.token"}]`: one file per client, one token per file, each read like every secret file (absolute path, no link, mode `0600`, owned by this account, at most 64 KiB). A name is lowercase letters, digits and `-`, starts with a letter, is at most 32 characters, is not `default` and is not twelve hex digits. A name used twice, or a token shared by two clients, is refused. An action by a named client carries the actor `api:<name>`; `default` keeps its derived id. `whr doctor` checks all of it as `api-clients` and names the client of a failing file. The CLI keeps using `default`.

    `integration_branch` is where approved commits go (the default workflow `integration` uses `develop` when it is not set, so the line only makes that visible); the branch must exist in the repository. A workspace rebases onto the same branch: `whr ws add` takes it from the configuration (for `published`, the default branch GitHub reports now) and refuses a `--branch` that differs, naming both, so a first workspace and its tasks meet on one branch.

    To mirror task state on a GitHub project board (provisional, issue #70, {{< status unverified >}} until it runs with the real App), add `"board": {"owner": "<organization>", "organization": true, "number": <project number>, "public_url": "https://<your-forwarded-name>"}`: the project needs a single-select `Status` field with the options `Needs you`, `In progress`, `Ready to push` and `Done`, and may have a `Session` field and a text field `Task` that holds the link. The App then needs the organization's Projects permission (`whr github app create --board` asks for it; `whr doctor` checks it).
    To sign in to the web UI and answer reviews from the phone with a passkey (provisional, issue #101, {{< status unverified >}} until it runs on a real phone), set `"public_url": "https://<your-forwarded-name>"`, restart, and run `whr passkey add phone` on the host: open the link it prints on the phone within 5 minutes. From then on the web UI signs in with the passkey only; `whr passkey ls` and `whr passkey rm <id>` manage them, and only on the host.
    **What the agent and the console may reach (`environment.egress_allow`, `console.egress_allow`).** The agent environment reaches `api.anthropic.com` and nothing else by default; the console reaches `github.com`, `proxy.golang.org`, `sum.golang.org`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org` and `files.pythonhosted.org`. An entry is **one exact host**: `github.com` admits `github.com` and not `api.github.com`, so a host you rely on is listed by name. A wildcard `*.example.com` (every subdomain, never the bare name) is allowed here, in your own configuration, and nowhere else: a repository's request for a host (its `devcontainer.json`, a lockfile) is one exact host that you answer as a Decision, and a request containing `*` is refused. To sign in to Claude Code with a subscription inside the environment (D40), the spike measured these hosts as the allowlist the flow needs: `claude.com`, `platform.claude.com`, `api.anthropic.com`, `auth.anthropic.com` and `statsig.anthropic.com` ({{< status verified >}} in [the sign-in spike](../spikes/agent-signin.md)); add them to `environment.egress_allow` before you sign in, and the same for the OpenAI hosts of Codex when that adapter exists. They are not in the default list, so the default allows no more than before.
    Add `"agent_api_key_env_file": "/Users/workharbor/.config/whr/agent.env"` only for an API key. `agent_allowed_tools` is required in the default `dontAsk` mode: only the tools listed there run, and the list above is an example to adapt. To approve each tool use yourself instead, set `"agent_permission_mode": "manual"` and remove the list: every prompt then arrives in `whr inbox` as an approval (`whr approve <id>` or `whr reject <id>`) and the agent waits for you for ten minutes before it is told no.
4. **Start it and create a workspace.** In `workharbor`'s desktop session, because the supervisor talks to Apple Container's per-session services (step 2): `whr serve` checks the whole configuration at start and lists every problem. The web UI is on `listen` (`http://127.0.0.1:8787/`, or your forwarded HTTPS name) and the `whr` commands use the API socket in the state directory (keep `state_dir` short: a unix socket path is at most 100 bytes): sign in with the API token, then use the dashboard, the inbox and the task pages from a browser or the phone (design §9.3). In another terminal: `whr ws add <name> --path <empty folder below a workspace root> --repo <owner>/<repository> --role <role>` creates the workspace, seeds its agent clone and starts its environment; `whr agent add <workspace> <role>` adds an agent. Then `whr run <issue-url> --agent <workspace>/<role>`. To keep it running, let launchd do it (provisional command): `whr service install` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.wstein.workharbor.plist` (mode 0644, yours), loads it into `gui/<your uid>`, and from then on the job runs `container system start --disable-kernel-install`, then `whr serve`, and starts it again if it exits, at most every 30 seconds. It refuses to run outside the graphical session (a shell from SSH or `sudo` is in another domain), with a `whr` that sits in a git working tree (the job runs the installed binary, `/opt/whr/bin/whr` or `$(brew --prefix)/opt/whr/bin/whr`, never a build of a topic; run `whr service install` from it, or pass `--whr`), and with a configuration that `whr serve` would reject. Output goes to `~/Library/Logs/whr/whr.out.log` and `whr.err.log`, which launchd does not rotate. `whr service status` shows whether it is loaded and its pid, and `whr service uninstall` unloads it and removes the plist.

## Remove the WorkHarbor account

`whr offboard host` (provisional, {{< status unverified >}}) does part of step 1 and steps 4 and 5 below for the default account `workharbor`. It is a dry run by default: it inspects read-only and prints what it would remove, including the home folder's size (`home-size`, read with `du` and without `sudo`) and the volumes mounted in it (`home-volumes`, then one `home-volume` line per mount point, or `none`). Each prints `unknown`, with a note, when it cannot tell: `du` exiting non-zero (common without `sudo`, when it cannot read a subfolder) discards its total, and a `mount` table that is empty, has a line that does not parse or lacks the root mount gives `unknown` alone, with no `home-volume` lines. A mount point that contains ` on /` is matched at every split of its line, so it may be listed with a longer name than its real one. A mounted volume is only shown, never a refusal, and what `sysadminctl` does with it is {{< status unverified >}}; a volume mounted after the plan makes the final recheck refuse and name it. `whr offboard host --delete` asks you to type `workharbor`, never takes an answer from `--answers` or `--unattended`, inspects again, runs `/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/sysadminctl -deleteUser workharbor -adminUser <you> -adminPassword -` and then verifies. `sudo` asks for its own password with echo off; whr reads the administrator password for `sysadminctl` itself, without echo, and writes it to `sysadminctl`'s standard input, never to its command line, environment, the protocol or any report, and it drops any password prompt of the tool from the relayed `tool output:`. Verified: `sysadminctl`'s usage text allows `-adminUser`/`-adminPassword` and says `-` requests a prompt. {{< status unverified >}}: that `-` reads standard input rather than the terminal, and a real deletion with this form (there is no man page for `sysadminctl` on the reference Mac). It refuses an account whose record has more than one name (an alias), a user ID below 500, the account you run as or that is logged in at the console (or whose console owner it cannot read), an administrator unless you add `--allow-admin`, and a home folder that is not a plain directory `/Users/workharbor` owned by the account. Of step 1 it reads only the record, the groups, the administrator membership, the console owner and the home folder; it does **not** check launchctl jobs, `/Library/LaunchDaemons`, sudoers files, FileVault users or automatic login (steps 1 and 3), the running processes (step 2), or backups (the paragraph below). Do those by hand with the commands below, as well as volumes (step 6) and any other account. After confirmation and the final account recheck, it records the deletion step in the administrator's `setup-protocol.jsonl` in the default state directory, before running sudo, then records the verification outcome and a digest of the attempted commands. If the protocol cannot be opened or written beforehand, nothing runs. A protocol failure after execution exits with an error and does not undo deletion. Dry runs and refused confirmations write no protocol. The typed word protects against a mistake, not against an adversary: a program in an administrator's session could feed it through a pseudo-terminal, and `sudo`'s own authentication is the real barrier.

After the account is verified gone, `whr offboard host --delete` also removes the login picture directory `/Library/User Pictures/Workharbor` of the `login-picture` step with `sudo /bin/rm -rf -- <dir>` (a constant path; a failure is only a note), because it lives outside the home; the dry run prints that command too. The `Picture` attribute goes with the account record.

Use this to delete the macOS user of WorkHarbor (`workharbor` by default, written `<user>` below; its record name is lowercase and its full name `WorkHarbor`) that step 2 created with `sysadminctl -addUser`: the user, its home folder and its access. **Deleting a user is irreversible, and the home folder goes with it by default: back up first** (the repositories, `~/.config/whr`, the state in `~/.local/state/whr`, the workspaces' work) and check that the backup opens. `whr setup` changed host-wide settings that stay after the account is gone: the power settings (step 4), the log-out setting, the firewall and SSH settings (step 8) and what the Brewfile installed (step 5). Undo those by hand if you want them back. None of the commands below was run on macOS 26: every one is {{< status unverified >}}, so read each one before you run it, as the administrator, never as `workharbor`.

1. **Inspect first.** Nothing here changes anything. Do not assume the name: the commands below write `<user>` for the account's real `RecordName`, which you use in every later command, and its home is `/Users/<user>`. The default name is `workharbor` (`WhrUser` in `internal/doctor/host.go`, decision D49); an account created before D49 may be named `whr` (home `/Users/whr`, the legacy name), and `whr setup host --user <name>` selects a non-default account (read, not run). A WorkHarbor account is meant to be a standard user (the `workharbor-user` check passes only for that and warns for an administrator).
    - `dscl . -list /Users UniqueID | sort -k2 -n` lists the names and IDs that exist {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `dscl . -read /Users/<user> RecordName UniqueID PrimaryGroupID` confirms the account {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `sudo ls -la /Users/<user>` lists what the home folder holds {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `id <user>` shows the user and its groups; the groups to remove in step 3 come from this output {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `sudo launchctl print user/$(id -u <user>)` lists what runs in its launchd domain {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `ls /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/LaunchAgents | grep -i <user>` finds a job of the account outside its home {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `ls /etc/sudoers.d` shows a sudoers file that names it {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `sudo fdesetup list` shows whether it is a FileVault user {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `diskutil apfs list` shows the workspace volumes of step 3 {{< status unverified >}}.
2. **Stop the sessions and processes.** First stop the containers and the service: in the account's session, `whr service uninstall` {{< status unverified >}} and `container system stop` {{< status unverified >}}. Then, as the administrator:
    - `ps -u <user> -o pid,comm` shows what still runs for the account {{< status unverified >}}.
    - Optional: `sudo launchctl bootout user/$(id -u <user>)` unloads its launchd domain {{< status unverified >}}; in one run by the user it printed nothing.
    - Optional: log the account out at the login window or over Screen Sharing {{< status unverified >}}.

    `sudo pkill -u <user>` is not needed: in the user's run, `sysadminctl -deleteUser` reported "Killing all processes for UID 502" itself, while an earlier `pkill` had reported "Operation not permitted" for six pids (observed once, cause not verified). Deleting the account while session processes still run may leave a remnant; that is {{< status unverified >}} too, so check with step 5.
3. **Note the access, and any automatic login.** Delete normally removes the group memberships itself (step 5 shows what one run printed), so nothing has to be removed by hand first. Write down the groups that `id <user>` printed (for example `com.apple.access_ssh`, `com.apple.access_screensharing`, `com.apple.access_ftp`, `com.apple.access_remote_ae`, `admin`); `dseditgroup -o checkmember -m <user> admin` reads whether it is an administrator {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser` shows whether automatic login names it; if it does, `sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow autoLoginUser` removes the setting {{< status unverified >}}. Step 3 keeps automatic login off, so there is normally nothing to remove.
4. **Delete the user.** `sudo sysadminctl -deleteUser <user>` deletes the account and, by default, its home folder; `-keepHome` keeps the folder {{< status unverified >}}. This is the irreversible step. Output observed once by the user for an account named `whr` (macOS version not recorded, not verified):

    ```text
    No clear text password or interactive option was specified (adduser, change/reset password will not allow user to use FDE) !
    Killing all processes for UID 502
    Removing whr's home at /Users/whr
    Deleting Public share point for whr
    Deleting record for whr
    ```

    The first line is a warning seen in that run; its meaning is not verified.
5. **Verify.**
    - `dscl . -read /Users/<user>` must fail with exit status 56 or an error naming `eDSRecordNotFound` as a whole word (the text "does not exist" alone is not enough and stays `not_verified`), for the account name and for any alias record name {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `id <user>` must fail with "no such user" {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `ls /Users` and `ls "/Users/Deleted Users"` show what is left of the home folder {{< status unverified >}}. Remove a leftover only after `sudo ls -la` on it shows what it holds {{< status unverified >}}.
    - `dscl . -read /Groups/<group> GroupMembership` for each group of step 3 must no longer list the name {{< status unverified >}}. Only if a group still does, remove the name with `sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d <user> -t user <group>` {{< status unverified >}}.

    Observed once by the user after deleting `whr` (macOS version not recorded, not verified):

    ```text
    dscl . -read /Users/whr          eDSRecordNotFound (-14136)
    dscl . -read /Users/workharbor   eDSRecordNotFound (-14136)
    id whr                           no such user
    id workharbor                    no such user
    ls /Users                        Shared  werner
    dscl . -read /Groups/com.apple.access_ssh GroupMembership   No such key: GroupMembership
    (the same for access_screensharing, access_ftp, access_remote_ae)
    dscl . -read /Groups/admin GroupMembership                  root werner _mbsetupuser
    ```

6. **Workspace volumes, only if their data should go too.** A volume of step 3 lives outside the home folder, so step 4 leaves it, and its files stay owned by a user that no longer exists, which shows as a bare number. Keep it if you plan to create `workharbor` again (a new account may get another user ID, and then ownership still does not match). To delete it: `diskutil apfs list` finds its identifier, then `sudo diskutil apfs deleteVolume <id>` erases it for good {{< status unverified >}}.

After the account is gone, `whr setup host` and `whr doctor` report that there is no user `<user>` and name the `sysadminctl -addUser` command of step 2 as the fix; they never delete one. Today, with the user present, the `workharbor-user` check passes (`workharbor exists and is a standard user`, or a warning for an administrator) and offers no `addUser` fix; only a missing user, or an answer from `dscl` that is not clear, shows it. That is how the code reads (`internal/doctor/host.go`, issue #319); it was not run against a Mac ({{< status unverified >}}).
