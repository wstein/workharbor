# Development harness

## Bootstrap checks
Python 3.11+ and Bash are enough for `make check`; no product runtime or container
engine is needed. Checks validate project document links, tracked JSON, required
artifacts, pending feature status, contract shape of the workspace example, and
coarse dependency boundaries. Harness regression tests inject broken references,
unsafe paths and forbidden dependencies to prove rejection. These checks do not
replace compilation, runtime authorization tests or a security audit.

## Feature loop
Read constitution → specify/clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement → converge.
Use generated Codex skills (`$speckit-*`) from `.agents/skills/`. Bootstrap 001 already
has a spec/plan/tasks; do not regenerate them without reviewing intended changes.
Use `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=specs/001-workspace-lifecycle SPECIFY_FEATURE_NO_PERSIST=1` on main for upstream prerequisite
scripts; create `001-workspace-lifecycle` for implementation.

Run `make check`, targeted behavior tests, then appropriate real-host/browser
acceptance. Record commands, versions, output summary, limitations and commit.
Implement product format/build/test targets in T001 before claiming product checks.
The architecture lint catches obvious prohibited references only; add compiler-backed
Elixir/Go dependency enforcement when application packages exist.

## Reproducibility and feedback
Pin dependencies and retain lockfiles. Avoid hidden developer-machine prerequisites.
Every task uses its own checkout; no shared database or test host by default. Capture
structured operation logs with correlation IDs, redact secrets and use failure-path
fixtures. Feed repeated review comments into a focused check or authoritative doc.
Review quality gaps and documentation freshness per release; do not schedule agents
or background services implicitly.

## CI
The included GitHub Actions workflow runs the same bootstrap checks on pushes/PRs.
It is optional infrastructure; local checks work without GitHub. Other forges can
run `make check`. Publishing a remote or enabling CI is outside this bundle.
