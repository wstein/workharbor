# workharbor — Design

**CLI:** `whr` · **Status:** Revised design, 30 September 2026 · No implementation or compatibility testing yet.

Revision of the original discussion summary (`agent-work-supervisor-summary.md`) after a four-role team review (architecture, security, product/CLI, feasibility/ops). Review ratings are value/effort out of 10. Claims about Apple Container, Socktainer, Coder and Portainer come from the original sources and are **unverified** until the spikes in §12 are done.

## 1. Goal

A self-hosted service in which AI coding agents carry out project work independently while one developer acts as human-in-the-loop (HitL): intervening, answering questions, reviewing and approving.

- Agents work repository issues, modify code, run tests, update issues and open or update PRs.
- The developer attaches via SSH or an editor temporarily. Disconnecting never interrupts the agent.
- Web UI and `whr` CLI are two clients of one API.
- First host: Apple-silicon Mac mini (16 GB, ~1 TB) on Apple Container. Other runtimes later via adapters.

The central concept is an **agent task supervisor with managed workspaces**, not an editor-centred dev environment.

## 2. Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment | On-premises, one developer |
| Hardware | Apple-silicon Mac mini, 16 GB RAM, ~1 TB |
| Runtime | Apple Container (per-container VM isolation); Docker/Podman/other microVMs later |
| Capacity | **4 concurrent instances realistic, 8 a stretch goal** (see §8) |
| Overhead | Light operational and resource cost |
| Access | VPN, temporary SSH, VS Code / JetBrains via SSH; code-server optional and later |
| Forges | Gitea, Forgejo, Codeberg, GitLab, GitHub (release 1: one) |
| CI | Drone medium/long term, behind an adapter |
| Auth | OAuth for the five forges (release 1: static token) |
