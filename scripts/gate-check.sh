# Review gate decision (#411, design pr-flow-landing "Flow" and "Security consequences").
# Usage: gate-check.sh <ordinary|carve-out> <statuses.json> <login>...
# <statuses.json> is the output of GET /repos/{r}/commits/{sha}/statuses: one array,
# or several (gh api --paginate --slurp). The latest status per context decides
# (highest id), so a newer failure supersedes an older success. Passes only when a
# required tier is the latest for its context, has state success and was created
# by one of the allowed logins. carve-out needs review/opus; ordinary accepts
# review/sonnet or review/opus. Empty login arguments are ignored; no login at all fails.
# Everything read from the JSON is data and is only compared by jq, never evaluated.
